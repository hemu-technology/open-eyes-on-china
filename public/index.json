China doesn’t even need tariffs to stop buying American products—but the US doesn’t have the same leverage.\nTake soybeans as an example. China can simply decide not to buy them, and lowering tariffs won’t make a difference.\nBut if the US says it won’t buy Chinese goods, will it actually reduce its purchases? Not necessarily.\nIn my view, this is a key disadvantage in the tariff war that Trump seemed to overlook.\nChina can always adjust its imports to reduce purchases of American goods. The US, on the other hand, may not be able to achieve the same effect with Chinese goods.\nIf Trump fails to recognize this and doesn’t come up with a strategy to address it, the US is the one that will ultimately suffer in the tariff war.\n💬 Reply 👤 吃兔子的萝卜:\n美国最大的问题是只聚焦在高端产品。那么必然可以通过非法途径获得。而中国产品中高低端都有，中低端一旦限制了，那么量的缺失美国很难补上，势必造成通胀和社会动荡。 The biggest problem for the US is that it focuses only on high-end products. These can always be obtained through illegal or alternative channels. China, on the other hand, produces both high-end and low- to mid-end goods. Once the supply of mid- and low-end products is restricted, the US would struggle to make up for the shortfall. This would inevitably lead to inflation and social unrest.\n👤 天庭饱满:\n特朗普管不了资本家，这才是最可怕的。美国跨国公司满世界捞钱，不给特朗普交保护费，他有什么办法？还要减税。我他妈的到处打仗，军费每年上万亿美金，结果就是免费给跨国公司打工。 The scariest part is that Trump can’t control the capitalists. American multinational companies are making money all over the world. If they don’t “pay protection” to Trump, what can he do? On top of that, he’s cutting taxes. Meanwhile, the US is waging wars everywhere, spending trillions on the military each year—essentially working for free for the multinational corporations.\n👤 星辰的征途:\n你说的有道理，我也同意。 但也不能小看了美国的韧性，看看新冠美国死了多少人，民间安之若素。 这不仅仅是调侃，中国有这么大掌控力的前提是，对全体国民负责。 美国只需要对部分人负责就行了，而且只需要让他们觉得负责就可以。 You make a good point, and I agree. But we shouldn’t underestimate the resilience of the US. Look at how many people died from COVID—yet the public carried on as if nothing had happened. This isn’t just joking. The reason China can exert such strong control is that it is responsible for all its citizens. The US only needs to be responsible for a portion of the population, and it only needs to make them feel that it’s responsible.\n👤 zb2082:\n这就要回到最初的那个话题了，美国为什么要跟中国打贸易战？在制裁前，中国以及国内某些公司一方面进口美欧日韩等国以芯片为代表的高科技产品，又同时不甘心落后积极建立自己的低端科技和产业，并不断积累技术向上攀登，打破欧美的科技垄断，当时网络上还流传着科技无国界的笑话，嘲讽中国及相关企业重复造轮子。现在看像是美国在掐自己的脖子，那只是因为它的对手是中国，并不是这招式不管用了，换成中国外的任何一个国家现在都已经被掐死了 This brings us back to the original question: why did the US launch a trade war against China? Before the sanctions, China and some domestic companies were simultaneously importing high-tech products like chips from the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea, while also striving not to fall behind by actively developing their own low-end technologies and industries. They kept accumulating knowledge and climbing the technological ladder, gradually breaking the Western tech monopoly.\nAt the time, there was even a joke circulating online about “technology has no borders,” mocking Chinese companies for “reinventing the wheel.”\nLooking back now, it seems as if the US is choking itself—but that’s only because its opponent is China. This tactic hasn’t lost its effectiveness; if the target were any other country outside China, it would likely have already been crippled.\n👤 JohnSun1974:\n这就是他说的非关税壁垒啊，因此他认为美国对中国（或EU）的关税应该比反过来才公平。然而这个逻辑十分奇怪，一般人完全不理解，把美国的名声搞得奇臭无比。这就是现在的国际秩序，好处都让太平洋西岸拿了，臭名全让东岸背了，因此西岸完全不想收复台湾打破这个秩序（手动惊喜） This is exactly what he calls a “non-tariff barrier.” That’s why he believes US tariffs on China (or the EU) should be higher than the other way around to be “fair.” However, this logic is very strange and hard for most people to understand, making the US’s reputation look extremely bad.\nThis is the current international order: the benefits all go to the West Coast of the Pacific, while the East Coast bears all the bad reputation. That’s also why the West Coast has no real incentive to “take back Taiwan” and disrupt this order (surprise, hand gesture).\n🧑‍💼 苏德上将​:\n🗣关税帝君没想明白一个事，或者说很多外国领导人都没想明白一个事，中国政府说出的话一定是集体意志。\n说出来了就要办，中国外交不搭理你，是没必要。但是搭理你了，证明有些事我要做了。外国则是管特喵的，我先喵喵喵几句，大不了我推特道歉，反正把天桶塌了民众都不一定能管我。\n其实有时候国人也没意识到这件事，或者说意识到了，但还不确切理解。\n而不是西方政治那套，政客是政客，执行者是执行者，它不是绝对的等号。其实不管是美国还是哪个国家，举一个大家比较能理解的，英剧《YP》《YM》，它的本意是解释文官群体（政府执行人员）与政客（资本选举代理人）的制衡和合作。\n其实就这一个框架可以解释大多数西方政府，政客在前台口嗨是不需要为执行负绝对责任的。政客可以在前台肆意表演，它所需要负责的只是这四年纸面上的政绩让好看就完了。还记得咱老中特别讨厌的就是哪个领导为了自己上任几年的政绩在地方一通胡搞么，短视是老中非常讨厌的行为，要是哪个领导被爆出来这么干了，赛博亡国论都要来了。\n这也是为什么我们听到哪个政客反中言论的时候，甚至觉得这个国家都讨厌，因为我们自始自终的想法都是你与你的执行一体，换句话说言行一致。\n所以有些政客第一时间听到中国发出什么什么政策的时候不以为然，觉得可能和自己政府一样。我口嗨而已，你看马克龙就是，一会切换戴高乐模式，一会走地鸡模式。你能接受中国外交形象出现这种模式么？中国有个词语叫朝令夕改，这个词是真的骂亡国气象的。中国还有些词，前倨后恭，令人发笑，两面三刀小人也。\n这半年不是一堆人分析特朗普采用了破窗效应的打法么，先提出一个对方完全不能接受的，再提一个可以接受的，这样还给了对方回国交代的权利，你看你美爸爸还是放过你了哦。\n结果他没想到的是中国每一步交往都不是考虑单纯一个外交会发生什么，而是站在中国大方针上来考量的，这就打破了对方的哭闹，你哭闹干我毛事，你的口嗨，不能影响我的步伐。\n所以他的离谱行为根本威慑不到人，你哭闹打滚只会让我们乐呵，你要想谈实际的那就坐到桌子上来聊聊。 The “Tariff Emperor” didn’t figure out one thing—or rather, many foreign leaders never figure out it: when the Chinese government speaks, it represents the collective will. Once something is said, it must be done. If Chinese diplomacy ignores you, that’s because it’s unnecessary. But if it engages with you, it means some action is about to happen.\nForeign politicians? Who cares—they just tweet a few words, and if it backfires, they can always apologize on Twitter. Even if the sky falls, the public may not be able to hold them accountable.\nActually, sometimes even Chinese citizens don’t fully realize this, or they sense it but don’t quite understand it.\nUnlike Western politics, where politicians and civil servants are separate entities, and one isn’t absolutely equal to the other. Take, for instance, the British series YP or YM—its original purpose was to explain the balance and cooperation between civil servants (government executors) and politicians (capital-elected agents).\nThis framework explains most Western governments: politicians can make wild statements in public without bearing absolute responsibility for execution. They just need to make the four-year record look decent on paper. Remember how our leaders particularly hated it when someone pursued short-term local achievements for their own tenure? In the West, such behavior would spark massive criticism, almost like a “cyber collapse” theory.\nThis is why when we hear anti-China rhetoric from Western politicians, we often feel like the whole country hates us—because we instinctively assume the politician and their executive branch are one and the same: words and actions should align.\nSo, when a politician hears China announce a policy, they may dismiss it, thinking it’s like their own government: just empty talk. Take Macron, switching between De Gaulle mode and “chicken on the ground” mode. Could you imagine the Chinese diplomatic image doing that? We have words for that: chaoling xige (orders change overnight), which signals national weakness. Or qianju hougong (arrogant then humble), used for laughable, two-faced schemers.\nThis past six months, everyone analyzed Trump’s “broken window” tactic: first propose something completely unacceptable, then a slightly acceptable version, giving the other side a chance to “report back” to their own people. Look, your “daddy US” let you off the hook.\nBut what he didn’t expect was that every step of China’s diplomacy isn’t calculated just for one meeting—it’s considered from the perspective of China’s overarching strategy. That breaks the opponent’s tantrums: your whining doesn’t affect my plan.\nHis absurd behavior could never intimidate anyone. Throwing a tantrum only makes us amused. If you want real negotiation, then sit at the table and talk.\n💬 Reply 👤 蝴蝶自在逍遥:\n捷克🇨🇿总统去见了大和尚，我们宣布不和他进行任何交往。最搞笑的是他们政府竟然说“总统与大和尚接触是属于私人性质，捷克与中国尚未建立最高层级别的直接沟通，因此中国这一举动不会改变现况”。真是搞不通他们的脑回路，一国总统与别人会面竟然说只是他的“私自行为”[好奇] The Czech 🇨🇿 president went to meet the Grand Monk, and we announced that we won’t engage in any official contact with him. The funniest part is that their government actually said: “The president’s contact with the Grand Monk is of a private nature. Since China has not yet established direct top-level communication with the Czech Republic, this action will not change the current situation.”\nIt’s really hard to understand their logic—how can a head of state meeting someone be called merely a “private action”? 🤔\n👤 钱钟超:\n老中几千年的文化传承下来，导致老中面对政治、外交、军事等方面，是极其严肃的，说出的每一个字，做的每一个决策，都慎之又慎。欧美曾经也是如此，也能严肃面对政治。但在这几年，文恬武嬉，变成了政客的口嗨大会，特朗普之流，上台就是胡吹，满嘴跑火车 The Chinese have thousands of years of cultural heritage, which makes them extremely serious when it comes to politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Every word they speak and every decision they make is treated with utmost caution. Europe and the US used to be like this as well—they could also take politics seriously. But in recent years, it has turned into a spectacle of empty talk by politicians. People like Trump come to power just to brag and spout nonsense.\n👤 paul:\n想得到东西只有两个方法，一个是抢，一个是换，如果没本事抢就老老实实回家看看有什么瓶瓶罐罐可以拿出来当的，别整那些没有的。 There are only two ways to get something: either take it by force or trade for it. If you don’t have the ability to take it by force, then just go home and see what bottles and jars you can offer in exchange. Don’t try to go after things that don’t exist.\n👤 Ashilipa:\n想明白这个难度太高了，西方哪怕是偏亲华的，大部分也是讲中国体制效率高，所以发展好，隐含的意思就是说你集权，尤其李家坡那几个小老头最近四处蹦跶吹中国，谁都知道他啥意思。等他们想明白中国决策是集体意志的时候，世界观真会塌的，离投共也不远了。 Understanding this is extremely difficult. Even the pro-China voices in the West mostly say that China develops well because its system is efficient. The implied meaning is that China is centralized. Especially those old gentlemen from Singapore who have been hopping around praising China recently—everyone knows what they really mean.\nWhen they finally realize that Chinese decisions represent the collective will, their worldview will really collapse. At that point, being sympathetic to China won’t be far off.\n👤 Amy chow:\n其实别看某些人天天说国外的政治更厉害，选秀政治人人参与，老中太爱打官腔。 其实他们自己也是中式思维，如果我们的官员也是那种只顾口嗨，朝令夕改，说话没个把门的。老百姓第一个跳出来说不严肃，把政治当儿戏。 Don’t be fooled by people constantly claiming that foreign politics is superior and that everyone participates in elections, while Chinese officials are all about bureaucratic talk. In reality, they themselves also think in a “Chinese-style” way. If our officials only cared about empty talk, changed policies overnight, and didn’t stand by their words, the public would be the first to jump up and say that politics isn’t serious and treat it like a game.\n👤 天辰映海:\n欧美那些国家，本质上还是一个部落联盟，酋长A说的话，不一定能代表酋长BCDEF的想法[捂脸][捂脸][捂脸] Essentially, those Western countries are still like a tribal alliance. What Chief A says doesn’t necessarily reflect the thoughts of Chiefs B, C, D, or E. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 🧑‍💼 Travis L​:\n🗣当然不会无限，甚至不会很久，大概在两年内就会出现极大变动\n因为美国挺不住，不是挺不住关税冲击\n而是挺不住不跟中国进行完全贸易\n至于我们还会不会恢复这个贸易伙伴的地位？不好说，有不小的可能不会\n思考这么一个简单的问题\n知道中国现在不太从美国买大豆了，同时中国的进口占全世界大豆贸易的接近70%\n那\n美国人，现在还要不要种大豆？中国不买你种了基本等于全烂，在一年时间内让美国去产生对这些大豆的使用需求，根本不可能\n那如果今夏不种了，特朗普又跟中国谈成了大豆贸易，哪儿来的大豆交货？违约了怎么办？\n你用存货去交货，中国要求当年的，怎么办？还是违约啊\n还有，你不种大豆了，这些地干啥？种什么？种完了能卖出去么？\n而实际的情况，比这个还糟\n美国各种农作物是高度工业化生产种植的，大企业去雇佣农户种植是主要形式（也就是地主/佃农），所以，这些大宗商品的农作物，在美国播种有着非常详细的日程表，地域区别很小，而大豆的播种时间，是七月份，已经过了 Of course, it won’t go on indefinitely, and it probably won’t last very long—major changes will likely happen within two years. The US can’t hold out—not because of the tariff impact itself, but because it can’t afford to not trade with China at all.\nAs for whether we will restore the US as a trading partner? Hard to say—there’s a significant chance that we won’t.\nConsider a simple question:\nChina now buys very little soybeans from the US, while China’s imports account for nearly 70% of the global soybean trade.\nSo, do Americans still want to plant soybeans? If China doesn’t buy, planting them is basically wasted. Within a year, it’s impossible for the US to create domestic demand for all these soybeans.\nNow, if they didn’t plant this summer, and Trump somehow negotiated soybean trade with China, where would the soybeans come from? What happens if they default?\nIf you try to deliver from storage, China demands soybeans from the current year—so again, it’s a default.\nMoreover, what do you do with the land if you don’t plant soybeans? What else could you plant? Even if you plant something else, can it be sold?\nIn reality, the situation is even worse.\nUS crop production is highly industrialized. Large companies hire farmers to plant (basically a landlord/tenant model). For these bulk crops, the planting schedule is very detailed and regionally consistent. For soybeans, the planting season is in July—which has already passed.\n💬 Reply 👤 Regulations:\n大豆主要是为养猪服务的，中国人吃猪肉已经很多了，再大幅增加是不现实的，但是美国有很多的好朋友好伙伴，可以发展他们吃猪来扩大大豆需求，比如鱿... However, the US has many allies and partners. They could try to expand soybean demand by encouraging more pork consumption in those countries, for example… 👤 小禾:\n以前美国人有段时间在国内推广过人造肉，就是为了给大豆找出路，不过2003那次坑中国人太狠了，哪个经销商和企业会跟他们玩，不要命了 There was a time when Americans promoted artificial meat domestically, mainly to create a market for soybeans. But back in 2003, they really screwed over the Chinese. Which distributor or company would dare play along with them again? Not a single one—it’s too risky.\n👤 小禾:\n烂在地里倒是不至于，打骨折卖还是有人买的，比如说印尼埃及这些穆斯林国家，因为不能吃猪肉牛肉又太贵所以豆制品是重要的蛋白质来源，但是这些国家都没啥钱，卖了之后田地还是得被盖茨，贝索斯这些互联网大地主给兼并了去。 It’s not like the soybeans would just rot in the fields. Even if they’re damaged, someone would still buy them—for example, in Muslim countries like Indonesia or Egypt. Since they can’t eat pork and beef is too expensive, soy products are an important protein source. But these countries aren’t wealthy, and after the sale, the farmland would still end up being acquired by big internet landlords like Gates or Bezos.\n👤 陈伟:\n看看美国人能吸盟友和其他国家多少血，比如印度给加了50%，日本韩国欧盟虽然就19%还是20%，看着不多，可是要求投资美国得上万亿美刀[捂脸]按美国人烧钱的速度看看能撑多久。。。撑得住估计就维持现状，撑不住还得有一番恶斗！ Let’s see how much the Americans can squeeze from their allies and other countries. India got hit with a 50% increase. Japan, Korea, and the EU only around 19–20%. It doesn’t look like much, but to invest in the US, we’re talking trillions of dollars. 🤦‍♂️ At the rate Americans burn money, how long can they really hold out? If they can manage, things will probably just stay as they are. If not, there’s going to be quite a fight!\n👤 貉犴韩:\n前两天youtube上看到一个买极飞无人机喷药的美国小哥，他种的就是大豆，打算持续观察一下后续怎么样 A couple of days ago, I saw an American guy on YouTube buying a XAG drone to spray pesticides. He’s planting soybeans. I plan to keep an eye on how things unfold. 👤 Heavn Deng:\n大豆不是大米存放时间很长的，而且因为不是人吃，良好状态下存个两三年，给猪吃也不是太大问题。问题在于，美国农场主资金链能不能挺住而已 Soybeans aren’t like rice that can be stored for a very long time. But since they’re not for human consumption, storing them in good condition for two to three years isn’t a big problem for feeding pigs. The real issue is whether American farmers’ cash flow can hold up.\n👤 风雨飘摇赶路人:\n真难说 看谁的经济能扛住 从美联储死活不降息，就看出传统投资领域不看好美国目前的经济 ...\n中国呢，也很难 转型消费型市场，是件很痛苦的事 注定是要抛弃一些人的，这些人沦为真难说 看谁的经济能扛住 从美联储死活不降息，就看出传统投资领域不看好美国目前的经济 ...\n中国呢，也很难 转型消费型市场，是件很痛苦的事 注定是要抛弃一些人的，这些人会沦为“人形干电池”，收入≈基本支出 因为消费型社会注定是个高层本社会，只有高成本才会形成GDP与收入的高占比，否则钱从何来。 这种高层本社会，会让处于收入边缘的人，无论如何努力都存不下钱 美国，日本，韩国 ... 都是这\n其实我更喜欢现在的构型，收入低生活水平不会有太大差异\n相比美国，中国还有很多牌没打，美国已经用完了国家借钱维持的牌，中国才刚刚开始\n也行这会是二十年的角逐 Hard to say. It depends on whose economy can withstand the pressure. Judging from the Fed’s stubborn refusal to cut interest rates, it’s clear that traditional investment sectors aren’t optimistic about the current US economy.\nChina faces challenges too. Transforming into a consumption-driven market is painful. Inevitably, some people will be left behind. These people may end up like “human batteries,” with income roughly equal to basic expenses.\nA consumption-driven society is inherently a high-capital society—only high costs can generate a significant share of GDP and income. Otherwise, where would the money come from?\nIn such a high-capital society, people at the lower end of the income scale can never save enough, no matter how hard they work. The US, Japan, and Korea all follow this pattern.\nHonestly, I prefer the current structure: low-income people don’t see a huge difference in living standards.\nCompared to the US, China still has many cards to play, whereas the US has already used up most of its leverage through national debt. China is just getting started.\nThis could very well turn into a twenty-year-long competition.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/will-the-24-tariff-between-china-and-the-us-be-extended-indefinitely/","section":"post","tags":["US","America","Tariff","China"],"title":"Will the 24% tariff between China and the US be extended indefinitely?"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Hugo"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/syntax/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Syntax"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/series/themes-guide/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Themes Guide"},{"body":"Page bundles are an optional way to organize page resources within Hugo.\nYou can opt-in to using page bundles in Hugo Clarity with usePageBundles in your site configuration or in a page's front matter. Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15 ├── .. 16 └── not-a-leaf-bundle 17 ├── .. 18 └── another-leaf-bundle 19 └── index.md In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\nAdvantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\nIf you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/bundle/","section":"post","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles"},{"body":"\r","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/map/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Using OpenStreetMap"},{"body":"The \u0026quot;Notices\u0026quot; shortcode enables you to call out pieces of information - sidebars, warnings, tips, etc.\nTo create a notice on a page, you can use the notice shortcode.\nYou use the notice shortcode, with the first parameter being one of note, info, tip, and warning.

Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.\nRemote image, specified caption The following image is loaded from a remote URL. The alt text is the same (for screen readers and in cases when the image doesn't load) but because a separate title is provided, the title is used for the caption:\nThis is Jane Doe Image with alt text and no caption Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:\nBlockquotes The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.\nBlockquote without attribution Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
