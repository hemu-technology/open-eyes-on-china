Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month. Talk about “system superiority,” huh? 😏💸 👤 阿0303:\n应该拿美国比更直观，两国人口差的不大，gdp差的大 If you compare with the US, it’s even more obvious — similar population, but GDP way higher.

Shanghai’s minimum wage is 2,748 RMB, just a few hundred more than Indonesia’s. No wonder Shanghai is like a “mini Mumbai” 😏📚 👤 Ashilipa:\n不高啊，印尼人民真勇 Not high at all… Indonesians are really brave! 😅💪 🧑‍💼 orochi2k:\n🗣 根据之前的剧情，这一起都是…… Based on what happened before, this whole thing is all… 😬 ![One Piece](../images/2025/v1-indonesia.jpg) ![](images/2025/indonesia-protests.png)","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/what-do-you-think-about-the-recent-labor-protests-in-indonesia/","section":"post","tags":["US","Indonesia","protest","China"],"title":"What do you think about the recent labor protests in Indonesia?"},{"body":"🧑‍💼 萤火的诗:\n🗣中国有一点美国比不了。\n那就是中国买什么都是可控的，美国却不是。\n中国甚至不需要关税就可以不买美国的东西，但美国做不到。\n就像大豆一样，中国说不买就不买了，降关税也没用。\n但美国会说不买，就不买中国的商品吗？\n在我看来，这才是特朗普没意识到关税战美国的劣势。\n只要中国突破什么，就可以少买一些美国货，但美国突破一些，不一定会少买一些中国货。\n特朗普如果意识不到这点，不想办法应对，那我认为关税战吃亏的是美国。 here’s one advantage China has that the US simply can’t match: China can control what it buys, while the US cannot. China doesn’t even need tariffs to stop buying American products—but the US doesn’t have the same leverage.\nTake soybeans as an example. China can simply decide not to buy them, and lowering tariffs won’t make a difference.\nBut if the US says it won’t buy Chinese goods, will it actually reduce its purchases? Not necessarily.\nIn my view, this is a key disadvantage in the tariff war that Trump seemed to overlook.\nChina can always adjust its imports to reduce purchases of American goods. The US, on the other hand, may not be able to achieve the same effect with Chinese goods.\nIf Trump fails to recognize this and doesn’t come up with a strategy to address it, the US is the one that will ultimately suffer in the tariff war.\n💬 Reply 👤 吃兔子的萝卜:\n美国最大的问题是只聚焦在高端产品。那么必然可以通过非法途径获得。而中国产品中高低端都有，中低端一旦限制了，那么量的缺失美国很难补上，势必造成通胀和社会动荡。 The biggest problem for the US is that it focuses only on high-end products. These can always be obtained through illegal or alternative channels. China, on the other hand, produces both high-end and low- to mid-end goods. Once the supply of mid- and low-end products is restricted, the US would struggle to make up for the shortfall. This would inevitably lead to inflation and social unrest.\n👤 天庭饱满:\n特朗普管不了资本家，这才是最可怕的。美国跨国公司满世界捞钱，不给特朗普交保护费，他有什么办法？还要减税。我他妈的到处打仗，军费每年上万亿美金，结果就是免费给跨国公司打工。 The scariest part is that Trump can’t control the capitalists. American multinational companies are making money all over the world. If they don’t “pay protection” to Trump, what can he do? On top of that, he’s cutting taxes. Meanwhile, the US is waging wars everywhere, spending trillions on the military each year—essentially working for free for the multinational corporations.\n👤 星辰的征途:\n你说的有道理，我也同意。 但也不能小看了美国的韧性，看看新冠美国死了多少人，民间安之若素。 这不仅仅是调侃，中国有这么大掌控力的前提是，对全体国民负责。 美国只需要对部分人负责就行了，而且只需要让他们觉得负责就可以。 You make a good point, and I agree. But we shouldn’t underestimate the resilience of the US. Look at how many people died from COVID—yet the public carried on as if nothing had happened. This isn’t just joking. The reason China can exert such strong control is that it is responsible for all its citizens. The US only needs to be responsible for a portion of the population, and it only needs to make them feel that it’s responsible.\n👤 zb2082:\n这就要回到最初的那个话题了，美国为什么要跟中国打贸易战？在制裁前，中国以及国内某些公司一方面进口美欧日韩等国以芯片为代表的高科技产品，又同时不甘心落后积极建立自己的低端科技和产业，并不断积累技术向上攀登，打破欧美的科技垄断，当时网络上还流传着科技无国界的笑话，嘲讽中国及相关企业重复造轮子。现在看像是美国在掐自己的脖子，那只是因为它的对手是中国，并不是这招式不管用了，换成中国外的任何一个国家现在都已经被掐死了 This brings us back to the original question: why did the US launch a trade war against China? Before the sanctions, China and some domestic companies were simultaneously importing high-tech products like chips from the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea, while also striving not to fall behind by actively developing their own low-end technologies and industries. They kept accumulating knowledge and climbing the technological ladder, gradually breaking the Western tech monopoly.\nAt the time, there was even a joke circulating online about “technology has no borders,” mocking Chinese companies for “reinventing the wheel.”\nLooking back now, it seems as if the US is choking itself—but that’s only because its opponent is China. This tactic hasn’t lost its effectiveness; if the target were any other country outside China, it would likely have already been crippled.\n👤 JohnSun1974:\n这就是他说的非关税壁垒啊，因此他认为美国对中国（或EU）的关税应该比反过来才公平。然而这个逻辑十分奇怪，一般人完全不理解，把美国的名声搞得奇臭无比。这就是现在的国际秩序，好处都让太平洋西岸拿了，臭名全让东岸背了，因此西岸完全不想收复台湾打破这个秩序（手动惊喜） This is exactly what he calls a “non-tariff barrier.” That’s why he believes US tariffs on China (or the EU) should be higher than the other way around to be “fair.” However, this logic is very strange and hard for most people to understand, making the US’s reputation look extremely bad.\nThis is the current international order: the benefits all go to the West Coast of the Pacific, while the East Coast bears all the bad reputation. That’s also why the West Coast has no real incentive to “take back Taiwan” and disrupt this order (surprise, hand gesture).\n🧑‍💼 苏德上将​:\n🗣关税帝君没想明白一个事，或者说很多外国领导人都没想明白一个事，中国政府说出的话一定是集体意志。\n说出来了就要办，中国外交不搭理你，是没必要。但是搭理你了，证明有些事我要做了。外国则是管特喵的，我先喵喵喵几句，大不了我推特道歉，反正把天桶塌了民众都不一定能管我。\n其实有时候国人也没意识到这件事，或者说意识到了，但还不确切理解。\n而不是西方政治那套，政客是政客，执行者是执行者，它不是绝对的等号。其实不管是美国还是哪个国家，举一个大家比较能理解的，英剧《YP》《YM》，它的本意是解释文官群体（政府执行人员）与政客（资本选举代理人）的制衡和合作。\n其实就这一个框架可以解释大多数西方政府，政客在前台口嗨是不需要为执行负绝对责任的。政客可以在前台肆意表演，它所需要负责的只是这四年纸面上的政绩让好看就完了。还记得咱老中特别讨厌的就是哪个领导为了自己上任几年的政绩在地方一通胡搞么，短视是老中非常讨厌的行为，要是哪个领导被爆出来这么干了，赛博亡国论都要来了。\n这也是为什么我们听到哪个政客反中言论的时候，甚至觉得这个国家都讨厌，因为我们自始自终的想法都是你与你的执行一体，换句话说言行一致。\n所以有些政客第一时间听到中国发出什么什么政策的时候不以为然，觉得可能和自己政府一样。我口嗨而已，你看马克龙就是，一会切换戴高乐模式，一会走地鸡模式。你能接受中国外交形象出现这种模式么？中国有个词语叫朝令夕改，这个词是真的骂亡国气象的。中国还有些词，前倨后恭，令人发笑，两面三刀小人也。\n这半年不是一堆人分析特朗普采用了破窗效应的打法么，先提出一个对方完全不能接受的，再提一个可以接受的，这样还给了对方回国交代的权利，你看你美爸爸还是放过你了哦。\n结果他没想到的是中国每一步交往都不是考虑单纯一个外交会发生什么，而是站在中国大方针上来考量的，这就打破了对方的哭闹，你哭闹干我毛事，你的口嗨，不能影响我的步伐。\n所以他的离谱行为根本威慑不到人，你哭闹打滚只会让我们乐呵，你要想谈实际的那就坐到桌子上来聊聊。 The “Tariff Emperor” didn’t figure out one thing—or rather, many foreign leaders never figure out it: when the Chinese government speaks, it represents the collective will. Once something is said, it must be done. If Chinese diplomacy ignores you, that’s because it’s unnecessary. But if it engages with you, it means some action is about to happen.\nForeign politicians? Who cares—they just tweet a few words, and if it backfires, they can always apologize on Twitter. Even if the sky falls, the public may not be able to hold them accountable.\nActually, sometimes even Chinese citizens don’t fully realize this, or they sense it but don’t quite understand it.\nUnlike Western politics, where politicians and civil servants are separate entities, and one isn’t absolutely equal to the other. Take, for instance, the British series YP or YM—its original purpose was to explain the balance and cooperation between civil servants (government executors) and politicians (capital-elected agents).\nThis framework explains most Western governments: politicians can make wild statements in public without bearing absolute responsibility for execution. They just need to make the four-year record look decent on paper. Remember how our leaders particularly hated it when someone pursued short-term local achievements for their own tenure? In the West, such behavior would spark massive criticism, almost like a “cyber collapse” theory.\nThis is why when we hear anti-China rhetoric from Western politicians, we often feel like the whole country hates us—because we instinctively assume the politician and their executive branch are one and the same: words and actions should align.\nSo, when a politician hears China announce a policy, they may dismiss it, thinking it’s like their own government: just empty talk. Take Macron, switching between De Gaulle mode and “chicken on the ground” mode. Could you imagine the Chinese diplomatic image doing that? We have words for that: chaoling xige (orders change overnight), which signals national weakness. Or qianju hougong (arrogant then humble), used for laughable, two-faced schemers.\nThis past six months, everyone analyzed Trump’s “broken window” tactic: first propose something completely unacceptable, then a slightly acceptable version, giving the other side a chance to “report back” to their own people. Look, your “daddy US” let you off the hook.\nBut what he didn’t expect was that every step of China’s diplomacy isn’t calculated just for one meeting—it’s considered from the perspective of China’s overarching strategy. That breaks the opponent’s tantrums: your whining doesn’t affect my plan.\nHis absurd behavior could never intimidate anyone. Throwing a tantrum only makes us amused.

Since China has not yet established direct top-level communication with the Czech Republic, this action will not change the current situation.”\nIt’s really hard to understand their logic—how can a head of state meeting someone be called merely a “private action”? 🤔\n👤 钱钟超:\n老中几千年的文化传承下来，导致老中面对政治、外交、军事等方面，是极其严肃的，说出的每一个字，做的每一个决策，都慎之又慎。欧美曾经也是如此，也能严肃面对政治。但在这几年，文恬武嬉，变成了政客的口嗨大会，特朗普之流，上台就是胡吹，满嘴跑火车 The Chinese have thousands of years of cultural heritage, which makes them extremely serious when it comes to politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Every word they speak and every decision they make is treated with utmost caution. Europe and the US used to be like this as well—they could also take politics seriously. But in recent years, it has turned into a spectacle of empty talk by politicians. People like Trump come to power just to brag and spout nonsense.\n👤 paul:\n想得到东西只有两个方法，一个是抢，一个是换，如果没本事抢就老老实实回家看看有什么瓶瓶罐罐可以拿出来当的，别整那些没有的。 There are only two ways to get something: either take it by force or trade for it. If you don’t have the ability to take it by force, then just go home and see what bottles and jars you can offer in exchange. Don’t try to go after things that don’t exist.\n👤 Ashilipa:\n想明白这个难度太高了，西方哪怕是偏亲华的，大部分也是讲中国体制效率高，所以发展好，隐含的意思就是说你集权，尤其李家坡那几个小老头最近四处蹦跶吹中国，谁都知道他啥意思。等他们想明白中国决策是集体意志的时候，世界观真会塌的，离投共也不远了。 Understanding this is extremely difficult. Even the pro-China voices in the West mostly say that China develops well because its system is efficient. The implied meaning is that China is centralized. Especially those old gentlemen from Singapore who have been hopping around praising China recently—everyone knows what they really mean.\nWhen they finally realize that Chinese decisions represent the collective will, their worldview will really collapse. At that point, being sympathetic to China won’t be far off.\n👤 Amy chow:\n其实别看某些人天天说国外的政治更厉害，选秀政治人人参与，老中太爱打官腔。 其实他们自己也是中式思维，如果我们的官员也是那种只顾口嗨，朝令夕改，说话没个把门的。老百姓第一个跳出来说不严肃，把政治当儿戏。 Don’t be fooled by people constantly claiming that foreign politics is superior and that everyone participates in elections, while Chinese officials are all about bureaucratic talk. In reality, they themselves also think in a “Chinese-style” way. If our officials only cared about empty talk, changed policies overnight, and didn’t stand by their words, the public would be the first to jump up and say that politics isn’t serious and treat it like a game.\n👤 天辰映海:\n欧美那些国家，本质上还是一个部落联盟，酋长A说的话，不一定能代表酋长BCDEF的想法[捂脸][捂脸][捂脸] Essentially, those Western countries are still like a tribal alliance. What Chief A says doesn’t necessarily reflect the thoughts of Chiefs B, C, D, or E. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 🧑‍💼 Travis L​:\n🗣当然不会无限，甚至不会很久，大概在两年内就会出现极大变动\n因为美国挺不住，不是挺不住关税冲击\n而是挺不住不跟中国进行完全贸易\n至于我们还会不会恢复这个贸易伙伴的地位？不好说，有不小的可能不会\n思考这么一个简单的问题\n知道中国现在不太从美国买大豆了，同时中国的进口占全世界大豆贸易的接近70%\n那\n美国人，现在还要不要种大豆？中国不买你种了基本等于全烂，在一年时间内让美国去产生对这些大豆的使用需求，根本不可能\n那如果今夏不种了，特朗普又跟中国谈成了大豆贸易，哪儿来的大豆交货？违约了怎么办？\n你用存货去交货，中国要求当年的，怎么办？还是违约啊\n还有，你不种大豆了，这些地干啥？种什么？种完了能卖出去么？\n而实际的情况，比这个还糟\n美国各种农作物是高度工业化生产种植的，大企业去雇佣农户种植是主要形式（也就是地主/佃农），所以，这些大宗商品的农作物，在美国播种有着非常详细的日程表，地域区别很小，而大豆的播种时间，是七月份，已经过了 Of course, it won’t go on indefinitely, and it probably won’t last very long—major changes will likely happen within two years. The US can’t hold out—not because of the tariff impact itself, but because it can’t afford to not trade with China at all.\nAs for whether we will restore the US as a trading partner? Hard to say—there’s a significant chance that we won’t.\nConsider a simple question:\nChina now buys very little soybeans from the US, while China’s imports account for nearly 70% of the global soybean trade.\nSo, do Americans still want to plant soybeans? If China doesn’t buy, planting them is basically wasted. Within a year, it’s impossible for the US to create domestic demand for all these soybeans.\nNow, if they didn’t plant this summer, and Trump somehow negotiated soybean trade with China, where would the soybeans come from? What happens if they default?\nIf you try to deliver from storage, China demands soybeans from the current year—so again, it’s a default.\nMoreover, what do you do with the land if you don’t plant soybeans? What else could you plant? Even if you plant something else, can it be sold?\nIn reality, the situation is even worse.\nUS crop production is highly industrialized. Large companies hire farmers to plant (basically a landlord/tenant model). For these bulk crops, the planting schedule is very detailed and regionally consistent. For soybeans, the planting season is in July—which has already passed.\n💬 Reply 👤 Regulations:\n大豆主要是为养猪服务的，中国人吃猪肉已经很多了，再大幅增加是不现实的，但是美国有很多的好朋友好伙伴，可以发展他们吃猪来扩大大豆需求，比如鱿... However, the US has many allies and partners. They could try to expand soybean demand by encouraging more pork consumption in those countries, for example… 👤 小禾:\n以前美国人有段时间在国内推广过人造肉，就是为了给大豆找出路，不过2003那次坑中国人太狠了，哪个经销商和企业会跟他们玩，不要命了 There was a time when Americans promoted artificial meat domestically, mainly to create a market for soybeans. But back in 2003, they really screwed over the Chinese. Which distributor or company would dare play along with them again? Not a single one—it’s too risky.\n👤 小禾:\n烂在地里倒是不至于，打骨折卖还是有人买的，比如说印尼埃及这些穆斯林国家，因为不能吃猪肉牛肉又太贵所以豆制品是重要的蛋白质来源，但是这些国家都没啥钱，卖了之后田地还是得被盖茨，贝索斯这些互联网大地主给兼并了去。 It’s not like the soybeans would just rot in the fields. Even if they’re damaged, someone would still buy them—for example, in Muslim countries like Indonesia or Egypt. Since they can’t eat pork and beef is too expensive, soy products are an important protein source. But these countries aren’t wealthy, and after the sale, the farmland would still end up being acquired by big internet landlords like Gates or Bezos.\n👤 陈伟:\n看看美国人能吸盟友和其他国家多少血，比如印度给加了50%，日本韩国欧盟虽然就19%还是20%，看着不多，可是要求投资美国得上万亿美刀[捂脸]按美国人烧钱的速度看看能撑多久。。。撑得住估计就维持现状，撑不住还得有一番恶斗！ Let’s see how much the Americans can squeeze from their allies and other countries. India got hit with a 50% increase. Japan, Korea, and the EU only around 19–20%. It doesn’t look like much, but to invest in the US, we’re talking trillions of dollars. 🤦‍♂️ At the rate Americans burn money, how long can they really hold out? If they can manage, things will probably just stay as they are. If not, there’s going to be quite a fight!\n👤 貉犴韩:\n前两天youtube上看到一个买极飞无人机喷药的美国小哥，他种的就是大豆，打算持续观察一下后续怎么样 A couple of days ago, I saw an American guy on YouTube buying a XAG drone to spray pesticides. He’s planting soybeans. I plan to keep an eye on how things unfold. 👤 Heavn Deng:\n大豆不是大米存放时间很长的，而且因为不是人吃，良好状态下存个两三年，给猪吃也不是太大问题。问题在于，美国农场主资金链能不能挺住而已 Soybeans aren’t like rice that can be stored for a very long time. But since they’re not for human consumption, storing them in good condition for two to three years isn’t a big problem for feeding pigs. The real issue is whether American farmers’ cash flow can hold up.\n👤 风雨飘摇赶路人:\n真难说 看谁的经济能扛住 从美联储死活不降息，就看出传统投资领域不看好美国目前的经济 ...\n中国呢，也很难 转型消费型市场，是件很痛苦的事 注定是要抛弃一些人的，这些人沦为真难说 看谁的经济能扛住 从美联储死活不降息，就看出传统投资领域不看好美国目前的经济 ...\n中国呢，也很难 转型消费型市场，是件很痛苦的事 注定是要抛弃一些人的，这些人会沦为“人形干电池”，收入≈基本支出 因为消费型社会注定是个高层本社会，只有高成本才会形成GDP与收入的高占比，否则钱从何来。 这种高层本社会，会让处于收入边缘的人，无论如何努力都存不下钱 美国，日本，韩国 ... 都是这\n其实我更喜欢现在的构型，收入低生活水平不会有太大差异\n相比美国，中国还有很多牌没打，美国已经用完了国家借钱维持的牌，中国才刚刚开始\n也行这会是二十年的角逐 Hard to say. It depends on whose economy can withstand the pressure. Judging from the Fed’s stubborn refusal to cut interest rates, it’s clear that traditional investment sectors aren’t optimistic about the current US economy.\nChina faces challenges too. Transforming into a consumption-driven market is painful. Inevitably, some people will be left behind. These people may end up like “human batteries,” with income roughly equal to basic expenses.\nA consumption-driven society is inherently a high-capital society—only high costs can generate a significant share of GDP and income. Otherwise, where would the money come from?\nIn such a high-capital society, people at the lower end of the income scale can never save enough, no matter how hard they work. The US, Japan, and Korea all follow this pattern.\nHonestly, I prefer the current structure: low-income people don’t see a huge difference in living standards.\nCompared to the US, China still has many cards to play, whereas the US has already used up most of its leverage through national debt. China is just getting started.\nThis could very well turn into a twenty-year-long competition.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/will-the-24-tariff-between-china-and-the-us-be-extended-indefinitely/","section":"post","tags":["US","America","Tariff","China"],"title":"Will the 24% tariff between China and the US be extended indefinitely?"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/hugo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Hugo"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/syntax/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Syntax"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/series/themes-guide/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Themes Guide"},{"body":"Page bundles are an optional way to organize page resources within Hugo.\nYou can opt-in to using page bundles in Hugo Clarity with usePageBundles in your site configuration or in a page's front matter. Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15 ├── .. 16 └── not-a-leaf-bundle 17 ├── .. 18 └── another-leaf-bundle 19 └── index.md In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\nAdvantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\nIf you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/bundle/","section":"post","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles"},{"body":"\r","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/map/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Using OpenStreetMap"},{"body":"The \u0026quot;Notices\u0026quot; shortcode enables you to call out pieces of information - sidebars, warnings, tips, etc.\nTo create a notice on a page, you can use the notice shortcode.\nYou use the notice shortcode, with the first parameter being one of note, info, tip, and warning.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education.

But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch.

The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything.

Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up.

As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them.

But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better.

But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist.

The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful?

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope.

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago.

The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs.

Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope.

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability. Investors planning to put money into Southeast Asia should carefully reconsider investments in Indonesia. Here are some major social issues in Indonesia that are hard to solve:\nHigh youth unemployment:\nOverall unemployment is about 4.8%, but among 15–24 year-olds, it’s as high as 16%.\nYoung people with no work and uncertain futures can easily destabilize society.\nHuge wealth gap and unfair income distribution:\nThe average monthly salary is around 3.09 million IDR (~1,500 CNY).\nMeanwhile, MPs receive 50 million IDR (~21,700 CNY) monthly just for housing allowances.\nEntrenched interest groups and elite capture:\nOrdinary people have little chance to advance.\nCurrent President Prabowo Subianto was married to Suharto’s second daughter (1983–1998).\nSuharto ruled Indonesia for over 30 years (1965–1998), amassing billions in wealth and causing mass civilian deaths (over a million).\nBottom line: For investors, Indonesia has potential, but these structural social and political risks cannot be ignored.\nOne Piece ","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/what-do-you-think-about-the-recent-labor-protests-in-indonesia/","section":"post","tags":["US","Indonesia","protest","China"],"title":"What do you think about the recent labor protests in Indonesia?"},{"body":"最低工资上调 10.5%、废掉争议劳工法《创造就业法》、取消外包模式、提高免税额度、取消遣散费与年终奖税收、设专门小组阻止裁员潮…… 以上是摘抄的最近印尼劳工抗议的部分条款，觉得很合理吗，对我们也适用。想知道大家的看法\nMinimum wage increase of 10.5%, abolition of the controversial Job Creation Law, cancellation of the outsourcing model, higher tax-free thresholds, removal of taxes on severance pay and year-end bonuses, establishment of a special task force to prevent mass layoffs… The above are some of the demands from the recent labor protests in Indonesia. Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability. Investors planning to put money into Southeast Asia should carefully reconsider investments in Indonesia. Here are some major social issues in Indonesia that are hard to solve:\nHigh youth unemployment:\nOverall unemployment is about 4.8%, but among 15–24 year-olds, it’s as high as 16%.\nYoung people with no work and uncertain futures can easily destabilize society.\nHuge wealth gap and unfair income distribution:\nThe average monthly salary is around 3.09 million IDR (~1,500 CNY).\nMeanwhile, MPs receive 50 million IDR (~21,700 CNY) monthly just for housing allowances.\nEntrenched interest groups and elite capture:\nOrdinary people have little chance to advance.\nCurrent President Prabowo Subianto was married to Suharto’s second daughter (1983–1998).\nSuharto ruled Indonesia for over 30 years (1965–1998), amassing billions in wealth and causing mass civilian deaths (over a million).\nBottom line: For investors, Indonesia has potential, but these structural social and political risks cannot be ignored.\nPresident Suharto ","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/what-do-you-think-about-the-recent-labor-protests-in-indonesia/","section":"post","tags":["US","Indonesia","protest","China"],"title":"What do you think about the recent labor protests in Indonesia?"},{"body":"最低工资上调 10.5%、废掉争议劳工法《创造就业法》、取消外包模式、提高免税额度、取消遣散费与年终奖税收、设专门小组阻止裁员潮…… 以上是摘抄的最近印尼劳工抗议的部分条款，觉得很合理吗，对我们也适用。想知道大家的看法\nMinimum wage increase of 10.5%, abolition of the controversial Job Creation Law, cancellation of the outsourcing model, higher tax-free thresholds, removal of taxes on severance pay and year-end bonuses, establishment of a special task force to prevent mass layoffs… The above are some of the demands from the recent labor protests in Indonesia. Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability. Investors planning to put money into Southeast Asia should carefully reconsider investments in Indonesia. Here are some major social issues in Indonesia that are hard to solve:\nHigh youth unemployment:\nOverall unemployment is about 4.8%, but among 15–24 year-olds, it’s as high as 16%.\nYoung people with no work and uncertain futures can easily destabilize society.\nHuge wealth gap and unfair income distribution:\nThe average monthly salary is around 3.09 million IDR (~1,500 CNY).\nMeanwhile, MPs receive 50 million IDR (~21,700 CNY) monthly just for housing allowances.\nEntrenched interest groups and elite capture:\nOrdinary people have little chance to advance.\nCurrent President Prabowo Subianto was married to Suharto’s second daughter (1983–1998).\nSuharto ruled Indonesia for over 30 years (1965–1998), amassing billions in wealth and causing mass civilian deaths (over a million).\nBottom line: For investors, Indonesia has potential, but these structural social and political risks cannot be ignored.\n![President Suharto](../images/2025/v21-indonesia.jpg (A family photo of former Indonesian President Suharto (Guess where Prabowo is? )))\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/post/what-do-you-think-about-the-recent-labor-protests-in-indonesia/","section":"post","tags":["US","Indonesia","protest","China"],"title":"What do you think about the recent labor protests in Indonesia?"},{"body":"最低工资上调 10.5%、废掉争议劳工法《创造就业法》、取消外包模式、提高免税额度、取消遣散费与年终奖税收、设专门小组阻止裁员潮…… 以上是摘抄的最近印尼劳工抗议的部分条款，觉得很合理吗，对我们也适用。想知道大家的看法\nMinimum wage increase of 10.5%, abolition of the controversial Job Creation Law, cancellation of the outsourcing model, higher tax-free thresholds, removal of taxes on severance pay and year-end bonuses, establishment of a special task force to prevent mass layoffs… The above are some of the demands from the recent labor protests in Indonesia. Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability.

I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable.

With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month.

On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians. I noticed it myself last month when traveling on Java Island — I chatted with a local young person, and they were really frustrated with government officials.\nSo yeah, there’s definitely revolutionary soil there.\n🧑‍💼 人间清醒:\n🗣 劳工万岁！\n我与印尼劳动人民素昧平生，\n我与他们同在，\n他们是真正的英雄！\n雅加达的最低工资标准2100+，东赢小孟买的最低工资标准2700+，东赢还是赢了。 Long live the workers! ✊ I don’t know the Indonesian laborers personally, but I stand with them — they are the real heroes! 💪\nJakarta’s minimum wage is 2100+, while Dongying’s “Little Mumbai” clocks in at 2700+… Looks like Dongying still wins. 😏\n🧑‍💼 momo:\n🗣 无产阶级的斗争，是好事，印尼正在经历我们以前的打土豪，斗劣绅，分土地的阶段。好日子在后头呢，坐等社会主义国家声援印尼无产阶级革命家。 The proletariat struggle is a good thing! 💪 Indonesia is basically going through the stage we once had: smashing rich landlords, punishing corrupt gentry, and redistributing land.\nThe good times are ahead — waiting for socialist countries to cheer on Indonesian revolutionary workers. 😏\n🧑‍💼 gkn cnyz:\n🗣 前面说印尼议员载歌载舞庆祝自己加薪，后面是印尼平民艰难讨生活，不抗议才有鬼了 Earlier, Indonesian MPs were dancing and singing to celebrate their pay raise, while ordinary folks are struggling to make a living.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing.

Do you think they are reasonable? Would they also be applicable to us? I’d like to know what everyone thinks.\n⬇️ Here are the comments 🧑‍💼 拉力赛冠军:\n🗣 还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题\n我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入\n社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大\n经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了\n补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义\n因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此\nCN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价\n那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现\n很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累\n发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现 It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem. I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.\nThe fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.\nEconomic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.\nTo add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.\nBecause in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.\nCN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.\nSo why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.\nMany people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.\nDevelopment has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.\n💬 Reply 👤 独树青峰:\n很多人以为换一种道路就没有问题，没有代价。 其实换一种模式还有会另外的问题和代价。 A lot of people think taking a different path means no problems or costs. In reality, switching models just brings different problems and costs. 👤 红与黑:\n你错了，十几年前觉得好是因为什么都可以说，什么都在慢慢改，所以有希望。现在觉得赛博亡国是因为什么都不能说，什么都改不了，甚至还可能被上门拜访。就如同一个缺氧的密闭罐子里慢慢憋死！这样说你能理解否？[思考] You got it wrong. Ten or fifteen years ago, people thought things were good because you could talk about anything, and things could slowly change, so there was hope. Now, people feel like we’re heading for a cyber-collapse because you can’t say anything, nothing can be changed, and you might even get visited for speaking out. It’s like slowly suffocating in a sealed jar. You get what I mean? 🤔\n👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 红与黑:\n很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份\n对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]\n仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了\n另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策\n我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已 A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status. For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔\nJudging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.\nYou also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.\nI still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.\n👤 谨言慎行:\n那么经济的发展是以什么来牺牲呢？ So, what gets sacrificed for economic growth? 🤔 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 谨言慎行:\n如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题 如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的\n不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度\n说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。\n天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大 If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue. But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.\nNo one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.\nAt the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.\nThere’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.\n👤 怦然心动的感觉:\n政府应该提前考虑这些潜在的风险，否则不是一个合格的政府 A government should anticipate these potential risks in advance — otherwise, it’s not a competent one. 👤 拉力赛冠军 reply 怦然心动的感觉:\n如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险\n有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何\n60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利 If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks. Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.\nFor example:\nIn the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.\nIn the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.\nWhen the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。\n正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。 When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up. The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.\n👤 迷途小书童:\n在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。\n当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。\n就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路： 对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。\n因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。\n例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。\n当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。\n如何对行业进行重塑？ 通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。 一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。 With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long. The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.\nWe can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:\nReshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).\nBreaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.\nFor example, renovation industry:\nMake it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.\nContractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.\nWhen more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.\nHow to reshape industries?\nImprove market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.\nConsumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.\nOne person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.\n👤 轩辕黄豆:\n确实，经济下行是原罪，经济弄不好，其他都是零 Exactly, economic downturn is the original sin — if the economy tanks, everything else is basically zero. 😅 👤 拉力赛冠军 -\u0026gt; 轩辕黄豆:\nCN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例 思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量 阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错 China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms. The strategy should definitely focus on:\nRaising income and living standards for the bottom layers\nContinuing anti-corruption efforts\nExpanding industrial scale and improving tech content\nClass stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.\n🧑‍💼 风信子​:\n🗣 导火索： 印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍\n加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）\n而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元） Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions. With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).\nAnd all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).\n💬 Reply 👤 仙舟人:\n我们体制内一年的退休金啥的，比这高多了，这不是体现了制度的优越性嘛 Our civil servants rake in more in one year of pension and perks than these MPs do in a month. Talk about “system superiority,” huh? 😏💸 👤 阿0303:\n应该拿美国比更直观，两国人口差的不大，gdp差的大 If you compare with the US, it’s even more obvious — similar population, but GDP way higher. Our civil servants still get way more in a year than these MPs do in a month. 😏💸 👤 人间清醒:\n啊？上海的最低工资标准2748，比印尼多几百，上海不愧是小孟买[暗中学习] Ah? Shanghai’s minimum wage is 2,748 RMB, just a few hundred more than Indonesia’s. No wonder Shanghai is like a “mini Mumbai” 😏📚 👤 Ashilipa:\n不高啊，印尼人民真勇 Not high at all… Indonesians are really brave! 😅💪 🧑‍💼 orochi2k:\n🗣 根据之前的剧情，这一起都是…… Based on what happened before, this whole thing is all… 😬 It’s the Straw Hat Pirates at work. =￣ω￣=\nApparently, the navy’s pay is 10 times higher than outsourced pirates, and the outsourced ones don’t even get social security — not even the Shichibukai get benefits. Then some guy with a straw hat goes around asking everyone, “What’s your dream? What kind of world do you want to live in?”\nMeanwhile, German media caught some Devil Fruit users in the protest crowd. The fruit in the photo is a Blur-Blur Fruit, so no matter how they shot it, the picture comes out blurry. =￣ω￣=\nThis one’s a Flag-Flag Fruit user — as long as they raise the flag, not even the navy dares to step forward, no matter how many there are. =￣ω￣=\nThen the navy tried to cut off the network, but they ran into a Buddha-Jumps-Over-the-Wall Fruit user. 😏\n🧑‍💼 Gene:\n🗣 印尼确实贫富分化很严重，而且贪污腐败也极其严重，而且，有一个很重要的点是官员们不作为，根本不作为，这个观念在印尼年轻人中应该有共识，因为上个月在爪哇岛旅行的时候和一个当地年轻人聊过天，对方对政府官员怨气很大，所以，确实有革命的土壤 Indonesia really has severe wealth inequality, and corruption is rampant. On top of that, officials do nothing — absolutely nothing. This seems to be a shared sentiment among young Indonesians. I noticed it myself last month when traveling on Java Island — I chatted with a local young person, and they were really frustrated with government officials.\nSo yeah, there’s definitely revolutionary soil there.\n🧑‍💼 人间清醒:\n🗣 劳工万岁！\n我与印尼劳动人民素昧平生，\n我与他们同在，\n他们是真正的英雄！\n雅加达的最低工资标准2100+，东赢小孟买的最低工资标准2700+，东赢还是赢了。 Long live the workers! ✊ I don’t know the Indonesian laborers personally, but I stand with them — they are the real heroes! 💪\nJakarta’s minimum wage is 2100+, while Dongying’s “Little Mumbai” clocks in at 2700+… Looks like Dongying still wins. 😏\n🧑‍💼 momo:\n🗣 无产阶级的斗争，是好事，印尼正在经历我们以前的打土豪，斗劣绅，分土地的阶段。好日子在后头呢，坐等社会主义国家声援印尼无产阶级革命家。 The proletariat struggle is a good thing! 💪 Indonesia is basically going through the stage we once had: smashing rich landlords, punishing corrupt gentry, and redistributing land.\nThe good times are ahead — waiting for socialist countries to cheer on Indonesian revolutionary workers. 😏\n🧑‍💼 gkn cnyz:\n🗣 前面说印尼议员载歌载舞庆祝自己加薪，后面是印尼平民艰难讨生活，不抗议才有鬼了 Earlier, Indonesian MPs were dancing and singing to celebrate their pay raise, while ordinary folks are struggling to make a living. If they don’t protest, something’s seriously wrong. 😏 🧑‍💼 小可则喜​:\n🗣 这锅印尼政府肯定跑不了，政策明显不合理，明摆着把民众当傻子。但是话又说回来，印尼这个欠发达政治又不成熟稳定的国家，也没太多好办法。毕竟都是为了支持率的需要，按照赵贞吉的话来说就是：先苦一苦百姓，骂名我来担。相比爆发抗议，爆发抗议的时间更值得玩味。世人都知道东大最近有两场大活动，印尼又是早早确定参加的国家。所以，这里面不排除有美日的煽风点火与推波助澜。 No doubt, the Indonesian government can’t escape blame — the policies are obviously unreasonable, clearly treating people like fools. But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”\nWhat’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing. Everyone knows there were two big events at Todai recently, and Indonesia had already confirmed its participation early.\nSo we can’t rule out some stirring from the US and Japan, fanning the flames and pushing things along.\n🧑‍💼 周天豪​:\n🗣 印尼目前的局势，一句话概括就是:\n不以阶级地位谈立场，都是耍流氓\n政府老爷们:这帮泥腿子，吃饱了撑的，不是我们老爷们给你们一口饭吃，你们都要饿死，还要涨工资？还要减税？还要加福利？不从你们身上榨取？难道钱从天上掉下来？给了你们一口饭吃，不让你们饿死，你们不但不知恩图报！还不知好歹，恩将仇报，看来你们是吃太饱了，要让你们活在吃不饱，饿不死的边缘，你们就没力气闹了！\n老爷们:娘希匹！闹这么凶？不怕，我们有兵！\n老爷们:奶奶的胸！泥腿子使出灭我暴力打手软肋的毒计，大事不好，幸好我早有N手准备，钱已存瑞士日内瓦，二奶私生子们已安放加利福尼亚，护照12345678，今晚私人飞机准时出发，明天洛杉矶别墅内泳池派对照常spa！\n老爷们:还有谁？比我赢麻？\n老爷们的附庸奴才:这帮该死的刁民，不替老爷们分忧，不站在老爷们的立场，顾全大局，敢出来闹事，全部罪该万死，死啦死啦滴！老爷们薪水十万美金一个月怎么了？那是老爷们应得的，实话告诉你们，这还是明面上看到的工资！早就说了不让你们看到天宫的生活，也是为你们好，徒增焦躁！老爷们凭本事贪的钱，你们眼红个鸟？有本事你能贪，我也给你当狗腿子！\n穷人做题家大学毕业:奶奶的，老子花了十几年时间，背了大几十万债才拿到的大学文凭，发现就连给老爷们当狗腿子的活，也全被裙带关系占住了，只能去当泥腿子骑手！他奶奶的同意，你爷爷的我也不同意！我抗议，抗议，抗议，抗到联合国也要抗议……\n骑手泥腿子:凭啥老爷们一个月10万美金，我们一个月200美金，凭啥老爷们婆姨成百上千，我们打手枪成百上千！虽然相比于200年前，我们生活进步了一点，用上了手机，骑上了摩托，吃上了2块肉，但是老爷们已经实现了别墅游艇跑车美女澳龙自由，不公平，不公平！我们要求涨工资，降物价，看病不花钱，上学不花钱！老爷们财产公示，降不合理工资！抗议，抗议，抗议……\n在印尼旅行时问过\n绝大多数印尼人做梦都想做老爷，可惜投胎概率太小，睡醒了想做狗腿子，哪里知道现实中是泥腿子，最惨的是，还养了个做题家的“大学生” The current situation in Indonesia, summed up in one sentence: If you don’t take class into account, you’re just messing around.\nThe elites: \u0026quot;These peasants, always whining. If we don’t give you a bite, you’d starve. You want higher wages? Lower taxes? More welfare? Money doesn’t fall from the sky! We give you just enough to survive, yet you bite the hand that feeds you. Looks like you’re too full — let’s keep you on the edge of hunger so you won’t have energy to revolt!\u0026quot;\nThe elites again: \u0026quot;Damn! They’re protesting? Don’t worry, we’ve got troops!\u0026quot;\nThe elites again: \u0026quot;Oh snap! The peasants found our weak spot! Luckily, I’ve got N plans ready: money in Geneva, mistresses and illegitimate kids in California, passports 12345678, private jet tonight, pool party in LA tomorrow — all as planned!\u0026quot;\nElites’ sycophants: \u0026quot;These damned troublemakers! They don’t support their betters, dare to protest… how dare they! We earn $100k a month — and that’s just the visible part! We hide our heavenly lifestyle for their own good. You jealous? Step up, try stealing — we’ll make you our lackey!\u0026quot;\nPoor “exam-obsessed” university grads: \u0026quot;Damn it, I spent 10+ years and hundreds of thousands in debt to get a degree, and even being an elite lackey is blocked by nepotism. I have no choice but to become a lowly rider! Screw it! I’ll protest — to the UN if I have to!\u0026quot;\nLowly riders: \u0026quot;Why do elites make $100k/month while we get $200? Why do they have hundreds of women while we…? Sure, life is slightly better than 200 years ago — phones, motorcycles, a bit of meat — but elites live in villas with yachts, sports cars, beauties, lobsters. Totally unfair! We want higher wages, lower prices, free healthcare and education, transparent elite wealth! Protest, protest, protest!\u0026quot;\nDuring my trip in Indonesia, I asked around:\nMost Indonesians dream of being elites — too bad reincarnation odds are slim. They wake up hoping to be lackeys… only to realize they’re lowly riders, and the worst part? They have to support an “exam-obsessed” university grad on top of it. 😅\n🧑‍💼 CRI元哲咨询​​:\n🗣 印尼长期积累的社会矛盾的一次爆发，如果不妥善解决，估计印尼社会和经济会长期的不稳定。因此建议计划投资东南亚的人士，还是要慎重考虑投资印尼的计划。\n印尼目前有以下社会问题，且难以解决：\n(1)青年人失业率高，虽然印尼整体失业率只有大约4.8%，但青年失业率方面，数据显示：15–24 岁年轻人中的失业率高达 约 16%。年轻人没事干，生活没着落，容易导致社会不稳定。\n(2)贫富差距大，收入分配不公正。根据印尼统计局的数字，在2025年初印尼平均月薪仅约309万印尼卢比（不到1500元人民币），但近期要给每个国会议员的每月房租补贴高达5000万印尼卢比（21700元人民币）。\n(3)利益集团盘根错节，吸血太狠，普通人无出头之日。现在的印尼总统普拉博沃是印尼第二任总统苏哈托的二女婿（1983年和苏哈托的二女儿蒂蒂克·苏哈托（Titiek Suharto）结婚，1998年离婚），苏哈托统治印尼30多年（1965-1998年，1967-1998年为印尼总统），期间敛财无数（超过百亿美元），杀人如麻（杀害平民超过百万）。 A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability. Investors planning to put money into Southeast Asia should carefully reconsider investments in Indonesia. Here are some major social issues in Indonesia that are hard to solve:\nHigh youth unemployment:\nOverall unemployment is about 4.8%, but among 15–24 year-olds, it’s as high as 16%.\nYoung people with no work and uncertain futures can easily destabilize society.\nHuge wealth gap and unfair income distribution:\nThe average monthly salary is around 3.09 million IDR (~1,500 CNY).\nMeanwhile, MPs receive 50 million IDR (~21,700 CNY) monthly just for housing allowances.\nEntrenched interest groups and elite capture:\nOrdinary people have little chance to advance.\nCurrent President Prabowo Subianto was married to Suharto’s second daughter (1983–1998).\nSuharto ruled Indonesia for over 30 years (1965–1998), amassing billions in wealth and causing mass civilian deaths (over a million).\nBottom line: For investors, Indonesia has potential, but these structural social and political risks cannot be ignored.\nA family photo of former Indonesian President Suharto. Guess where Prabowo is? During Suharto’s rule:\n1965–1967: 500,000–1,000,000 ethnic Chinese killed.\n1998: Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese killed.\nEast Timor invasion: Tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand East Timorese civilians killed.\nSuharto’s regime was marked by extreme violence and mass killings.\nEast Timor By proportion, Suharto’s atrocities in East Timor may have been even worse than Pol Pot’s.\nPrabowo, Suharto’s second son-in-law and current Indonesian president, also planned and participated in killings of East Timorese civilians and ethnic Chinese in Indonesia during Suharto’s regime.\nPol Pot pic Suharto and his cronies were never fully held accountable after stepping down. Over 20 years later, his former son-in-law, Prabowo, was elected Indonesian president in 2024.\nSuharto’s son-in-law, Prabowo, the current Indonesian president Prabowo and his ex-wife Titiek Suharto were married from 1983 to 1998 Siti Hediati Hariyadi (born April 14, 1959), commonly known as Titiek Suharto, is an Indonesian entrepreneur and politician. She is the second daughter (fourth child) of Indonesia’s second president, Suharto.
