**Welcome to "Open Eyes on China" 👀🇨🇳**  

Our mission is simple yet meaningful:  
1. **Breaking Stereotypes 💡** – We translate popular news and trending online discussions from China into English, offering the world a window into the real voices and opinions of Chinese people.  
2. **Cultural Exchange 🌉** – By sharing both Chinese and global perspectives, we aim to promote understanding, connection, and inclusiveness across cultures.

## Why We Exist ❓  
Too often, people outside China only see the country through filtered headlines or political narratives. But behind the news, there are millions of everyday voices—sometimes humorous 😂, sometimes critical 🤔, sometimes emotional ❤️—that rarely reach a global audience. We believe these voices deserve to be heard, because they reveal a more authentic, diverse, and human side of China.

## What We Do 🛠️  
- Translate **real comments 💬, discussions 🗣️, and opinions 💭** from Chinese netizens into English.  
- Provide **context 📚 and explanations 🧭** when cultural references may be difficult to understand.  
- Share **stories 📖 and perspectives 🌍** that highlight common values, differences, and connections between China and the world.

## Our Vision 🔭  
We hope to build a bridge 🌉 where curiosity meets understanding. By reading unfiltered voices, international audiences can see that people—no matter where they are from—share similar hopes ✨, frustrations 😅, humor 😆, and dreams 🌙.

- **Authenticity ✅** – We stay true to the original voices and context of Chinese netizens.
