还是那句话，经济上行快速发展的时候，绝大多数社会矛盾不会成为问题。经济下行的时候，所有社会矛盾都可以成为问题

我知道很多人会拿cn说事，不过我想说，今天被知乎er们批判的特权，福利待遇不平等，门阀学阀近亲繁殖的问题在十年前或者二十年前发展比现在快的时代也是存在的，甚至可能更加肆无忌惮，贪腐几乎无孔不入

社会矛盾不被提及不代表不存在，那个时候很多人也会抱怨这些问题，但是多数人没有那么大怨气，这不是因为社会矛盾不存在，而是因为经济的快速发展掩盖了很多社会问题，而且，说实话，当时的地域不平等问题，城乡不平等问题比贫富差异和分配问题还大

经济发展可以解决很多问题，但是解决不了所有问题。经济下行期问题就会暴露，各位应该知道三十多年前的通货膨胀吧，最后的结果可比现在爆多了

补充一些，关于社会矛盾的讨论，很多乎友会强调制度的重要性，因此有了“秦制“之类的观点。这个观点怎么评价？基本没什么意义

因为很大程度上，这些人忽略了三个在国家政策制订中非常重要的因素，即自然条件，地缘环境，历史路径，很多时候某个国家选择某种制度或者路径离不开这三者的共同作用。而且，相似的制度和规划在不同的国家有不同的效果，原因也在于此

CN和韩国的情况有很多类似的地方，后发国家，制造业强劲，社会压力大，内卷严重，这就是所谓“荣耀的代价”，用几十年发展做到和欧美老牌工业国接近的技术水平和工业能力，甚至在一部分领域领先全球，这样的成绩很耀眼，但是一大堆的社会问题即是发展代价

那么为什么还要这样发展？为什么这种并不人道极其残酷的路径还被认为很成功？因为不选择这种路径，工业化水平落后，会有别的社会问题出现

很多知乎er感叹十几年前的美好，但是我想说，十几年前的很多问题放到今天那怕不是要赛博亡国了，00年代的传销遍地，贪腐无孔不入，血汗工厂的残酷甚于今天，更不要说广大任何权益都得不到保障的农民工，混乱的治安，极度贫穷落后的农村，这些问题在这些年的发展中逐渐缓解，但是新的问题和矛盾逐渐积累

发展从来不是一件一蹴而就，顺风顺水的事情，民众的权益保障进步也是这样，解决了旧的问题就会有新的问题出现

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It’s still the same point: when the economy is booming and growing rapidly, most social conflicts don’t become real problems. But when the economy slows down, every social conflict can turn into a problem.

I know a lot of people will bring up CN as an example. But the so-called privileges, inequality in benefits, nepotism in academia and bureaucracy, and rampant corruption being criticized today were also there ten or twenty years ago, when growth was even faster. In fact, back then, these issues might have been even more blatant, and corruption penetrated almost every corner.

The fact that social contradictions weren’t loudly discussed back then doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. People complained, but the resentment wasn’t as intense. That’s not because problems weren’t real, but because rapid growth masked them. And to be honest, at that time, regional inequality and the urban–rural divide were even bigger issues than wealth inequality or distribution.

Economic growth can solve a lot of problems, but not all of them. When the economy slows, problems inevitably surface. Remember the inflation more than 30 years ago? The consequences then were far worse than what we’re seeing now.

To add something: in discussions about social conflicts, many people like to stress the importance of institutions, which leads to ideas like the “Qin system.” How meaningful is that? Not much, really.

Because in reality, people often ignore three critical factors in national policy-making: natural conditions, geopolitical environment, and historical path. A country’s choice of system or development model can rarely be separated from these three. And the same institutional design can yield very different outcomes across different countries precisely because of these factors.

CN and South Korea share many similarities: late industrializers, strong manufacturing base, huge social pressure, and severe competition. This is the so-called “price of glory.” In just a few decades, reaching technological and industrial levels close to the established Western powers—and even surpassing them in some areas—is an extraordinary achievement. But the flip side is a whole set of social problems that come as the cost of such development.

So why take this path at all? Why is this harsh and often inhumane model still considered successful? Because the alternative—lagging in industrialization—would bring a different set of serious social problems.

Many people on Zhihu reminisce about how much better things seemed a decade or two ago. But if those old problems existed today, wouldn’t they look like a cyberpunk dystopia? Back in the 2000s, pyramid schemes were everywhere, corruption was unchecked, sweatshops were even worse than now, not to mention migrant workers who had no rights or protections, chaotic public safety, and extremely poor rural areas. Many of those issues have gradually been alleviated through development over the years. But new problems and contradictions have accumulated in their place.

Development has never been smooth or achieved overnight. The protection of citizens’ rights advances in the same way—solving old problems only to encounter new ones.

很大程度上看你如何看待，以及你本人的情况，本人的身份

对于大城市的白领和小资来说，那十五年前确实更爽。但是对于很多小城市，县城，农村的人来说，这十年才是真正的生活水平提高，基础设施完善，基层恶霸和黑社会组织被整治的时期[思考]

仅仅从个人角度评判一些问题是偏颇的，被扶贫的农民没多少人上知乎，也没多少人在乎知乎怎么看，他们更不在乎舆论是否被监管了

另外，你得考虑一下14年，16年国际上的变化，中国周围地缘环境的紧张，这些都会影响内部的政策

我还是那句话，每个人总能通过互联网看到自己想看到的东西，不管有没有审核，但是怎么思考，怎么判断就是自己决定的，这和你的成长经历，工作性质，生活环境，教育水平息息相关，你能从墙外看到的我都能看到，但是我和你得出了不一样的结论，仅此而已

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
A lot depends on how you see things and your personal situation or status.

For white-collar workers and young urbanites in big cities, 15 years ago really was better. But for people in smaller cities, counties, and rural areas, the past ten years have actually been when living standards improved, infrastructure got better, and local bullies and organized crime were cracked down on. 🤔

Judging things purely from a personal perspective is biased. Most farmers who benefited from poverty alleviation aren’t on Zhihu, and they don’t care about Zhihu or whether speech is monitored.

You also have to consider international changes around 2014–2016 and the geopolitical tensions around China — all of which influenced domestic policies.

I still stick to this: everyone can find whatever they want on the Internet, regardless of censorship. But how you think and judge things depends on your upbringing, job, environment, and education. I can see everything you see outside the firewall, but I’ve drawn different conclusions — that’s all.

如果自带矿场或者油井，比如沙特，那这根本就不是什么问题
如果是人多但是资源不充足的后发国家基本全都是靠牛马血汗了，日本，韩国，cn都是这样，工业化的过程极其残酷，但是没有这个做大蛋糕的过程，谈分蛋糕就是没有意义的

不会有人真想回到前30年吧？工业发展不一定能带来普遍的富裕，但是没有工业化的人口大国大概率普遍贫穷，比如印度

说到底，现在的问题就是“荣耀的代价”，比如中韩用几十年时间完成了欧美几百年的路程，那么积累的社会问题必然更加集中。

天下没有免费的午餐，很多知乎er们批判社会制度的时候从来不提历史发展脉络，自然地理条件和地缘环境等等问题，好像选票民主和私有化可以根治一切。CN今天的发展成果和社会问题离不开地缘环境的压力，历史路径的积累，这两点对于政策的制定影响非常大
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
If a country has its own mines or oil fields, like Saudi Arabia, this isn’t really an issue.

But for late-developing countries with lots of people but limited resources, it’s basically all built on the sweat and labor of the masses. Japan, Korea, and China are all like this — industrialization was brutal. Without that “cake-making” process, talking about “dividing the cake” is meaningless.

No one really wants to go back to the first 30 years, right? Industrial growth doesn’t always bring widespread wealth, but population-heavy countries without industrialization are very likely to stay poor — look at India.

At the end of the day, the problem now is the “cost of glory.” China and Korea achieved in decades what took Europe and the US centuries, so social issues inevitably pile up.

There’s no free lunch. Many people criticizing society on Zhihu ignore historical context, geography, and geopolitics, acting like democracy and privatization can solve everything. China’s current achievements and problems are deeply tied to geopolitical pressures and historical development paths, which hugely affect policy decisions.

如果没有外部或者内部的压力，矛盾不暴露，不会有任何一家政府主动考虑这种风险

有远见，会考虑这些风险的只是个人，不会是一个官僚体系，区别就在于有远见的人的话语权如何

60年代欧洲开始大面积搞福利，很大一个原因就是苏联的外部压力，70年代弗朗哥政权提高福利，80年代韩国的民主化很大程度上来自于内部和外部的同时冲击。当底层维稳成本或者应对外部压力的成本大于福利支出时，那么就必然要提高底层福利
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
If there’s no internal or external pressure, conflicts don’t surface, and no government will proactively consider these risks.

Only individuals with foresight think about such risks — bureaucracies rarely do. The key difference is how much influence those foresighted people have.

For example:

In the 1960s, Europe rolled out large-scale welfare programs largely due to external pressure from the Soviet Union.

In the 1970s, Franco’s regime in Spain expanded welfare.

In the 1980s, South Korea’s democratization was driven by both internal and external shocks.

When the cost of stabilizing the lower class or dealing with external pressure exceeds welfare spending, governments have no choice but to improve the welfare of the bottom layers.

面对长期积累下来的大量社会问题，不要想着一个一个问题慢慢的去解决，否则只会一波未平一波再起，问题只会越积越多。

正确思路是直接建立一套社会信任机制，然后利用这套社会信任机制，把由各种坑蒙拐骗引发的大量社会问题成批量解决掉。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
When a society faces a pile of long-accumulated problems, don’t think you can fix them one by one — otherwise, as soon as you solve one, another pops up, and the problems just keep piling up.

The right approach is to build a social trust system, and then use that system to tackle large numbers of problems caused by scams, fraud, and exploitation all at once.

在百万亿负债面前，不看好能提高多少福利，而只要就业问题得不到有效解决，即便强行提高福利也难以保持多长时间。

当前最紧要的不是提高多少福利，而是提高多少就业，唯有充分的就业才能走出当前困境。

就业问题的解决不能再依靠传统路径，因为如果有效就不会走到当前局面，所以必须突破传统，采用全新的思路：
对市场上众多劣币驱逐良币的行业（食品，餐饮，中药材，医美，婚恋，中介，旅游，装修，本地服务……）进行重塑（重新洗牌）。

因为对行业的重塑会打破行业原有利益格局，重塑过程中就会产生非常多的投资机会与就业机会。

例如对装修行业的重塑：让业主更容易找到靠谱的装修师傅来使装修师傅获得更多的收入，师傅收入更多后就会产生更多的有效消费，然后带动更广泛的就业（图片内有更多介绍）。

当许多行业的更多从业者能够分到行业中更多的钱时，广泛的消费就会促进各行业相互发展，进而大幅活跃经济、提振消费、增加就业、扩大内需。

如何对行业进行重塑？
通过改善市场竞争机制来让能够保证产品（实物产品+服务产品）质量的从业者/商家容易从市场中突显出来，那么消费者通过快速找到这些从业者/商家来购买到有质量保证的产品。
一个人的消费是另一个人的收入，通过引导广大消费者的消费方向来影响从业者/商家的收入，就可以对众多行业进行重塑。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
With trillions in debt, it’s unrealistic to expect welfare to rise much. As long as employment isn’t effectively addressed, even forcing higher welfare won’t last long.

The real priority isn’t how much welfare we can raise, but how many jobs we can create. Only full employment can get us out of the current predicament.

We can’t solve employment the traditional way — if that worked, we wouldn’t be in this mess. We need fresh thinking:

Reshape industries where “bad money drives out good” (food, restaurants, traditional medicine, beauty, matchmaking, real estate services, tourism, renovation, local services…).

Breaking old industry structures creates tons of investment and job opportunities.

For example, renovation industry:

Make it easier for homeowners to find reliable contractors.

Contractors earn more → more effective consumption → broader job creation.

When more workers get a fairer share of industry revenue, widespread consumption drives other industries, boosting the economy, consumption, employment, and domestic demand.

How to reshape industries?

Improve market competition mechanisms so workers/businesses that guarantee product/service quality can stand out.

Consumers quickly find these high-quality providers → spend money → income flows to reliable providers.

One person’s spending becomes another’s income. By guiding consumer behavior, we can reshape multiple industries at once.

CN的情况基本上是历史上独一份了，无论是内部矛盾，外部环境还是产业发展，这决定了CN接下来的改革没有任何可供参考的案例
思路上肯定是需要提高底层收入和生活水平，继续打击腐败，扩大产业的规模优势并且提高技术含量
阶级固化和分化依然会变大，但是只要保证底层有不错的生活水平，整个政治经济体系依旧会很稳固，老欧洲这些年经济不景气但是社会矛盾并不严重，很大程度上在于底层吃福利都能过得不错
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
China’s situation is basically one of a kind in history. With its unique combination of internal conflicts, external environment, and industrial development, there’s no existing case to follow for upcoming reforms.

The strategy should definitely focus on:

Raising income and living standards for the bottom layers

Continuing anti-corruption efforts

Expanding industrial scale and improving tech content

Class stratification will still increase, but as long as the bottom layers live decently, the political and economic system stays stable. Look at old Europe: even with weak economies in recent years, social conflicts remain limited, largely because the bottom layers can live well on welfare.

印尼调高国会议员住房补贴至5000万印尼盾（约合3057美元，即约21800元人民币），这相当于印尼首都雅加达地区最低工资标准的将近10倍，是印尼国内贫困地区最低工资标准的近20倍

加上其他补贴，印尼国会议员每月可获得超过1亿印尼盾的收入（约合6062美元，即约43227元人民币）

而2024年印尼GDP仅约1.4万亿美元（我国2024年GDP超过18万亿美元）

Indonesia just bumped up MPs’ housing allowance to 50 million rupiah (~3,057 USD / ~21,800 CNY) — that’s almost 10 times Jakarta’s minimum wage and 20 times the minimum wage in poorer regions.

With other allowances, MPs can pull in over 100 million rupiah a month (~6,062 USD / ~43,227 CNY).

And all this while Indonesia’s GDP for 2024 is only around 1.4 trillion USD (compared to China’s 18 trillion USD).

No doubt, the Indonesian government can’t escape blame — the policies are obviously unreasonable, clearly treating people like fools.

But on the other hand, Indonesia is still underdeveloped and politically immature, so there aren’t many good options. After all, it’s all about maintaining support. As Zhao Zhenji said: “Let the people suffer a bit first, I’ll take the blame.”

What’s even more interesting than the protests themselves is the timing. Everyone knows there were two big events at Todai recently, and Indonesia had already confirmed its participation early.

So we can’t rule out some stirring from the US and Japan, fanning the flames and pushing things along.

老爷们:还有谁？比我赢麻？

老爷们的附庸奴才:这帮该死的刁民，不替老爷们分忧，不站在老爷们的立场，顾全大局，敢出来闹事，全部罪该万死，死啦死啦滴！老爷们薪水十万美金一个月怎么了？那是老爷们应得的，实话告诉你们，这还是明面上看到的工资！早就说了不让你们看到天宫的生活，也是为你们好，徒增焦躁！老爷们凭本事贪的钱，你们眼红个鸟？有本事你能贪，我也给你当狗腿子！

穷人做题家大学毕业:奶奶的，老子花了十几年时间，背了大几十万债才拿到的大学文凭，发现就连给老爷们当狗腿子的活，也全被裙带关系占住了，只能去当泥腿子骑手！他奶奶的同意，你爷爷的我也不同意！我抗议，抗议，抗议，抗到联合国也要抗议……

骑手泥腿子:凭啥老爷们一个月10万美金，我们一个月200美金，凭啥老爷们婆姨成百上千，我们打手枪成百上千！虽然相比于200年前，我们生活进步了一点，用上了手机，骑上了摩托，吃上了2块肉，但是老爷们已经实现了别墅游艇跑车美女澳龙自由，不公平，不公平！我们要求涨工资，降物价，看病不花钱，上学不花钱！老爷们财产公示，降不合理工资！抗议，抗议，抗议……

The current situation in Indonesia, summed up in one sentence:

If you don’t take class into account, you’re just messing around.

The elites:
"These peasants, always whining. If we don’t give you a bite, you’d starve. You want higher wages? Lower taxes? More welfare? Money doesn’t fall from the sky! We give you just enough to survive, yet you bite the hand that feeds you. Looks like you’re too full — let’s keep you on the edge of hunger so you won’t have energy to revolt!"

The elites again:
"Damn! They’re protesting? Don’t worry, we’ve got troops!"

The elites again:
"Oh snap! The peasants found our weak spot! Luckily, I’ve got N plans ready: money in Geneva, mistresses and illegitimate kids in California, passports 12345678, private jet tonight, pool party in LA tomorrow — all as planned!"

Elites’ sycophants:
"These damned troublemakers! They don’t support their betters, dare to protest… how dare they! We earn $100k a month — and that’s just the visible part! We hide our heavenly lifestyle for their own good. You jealous? Step up, try stealing — we’ll make you our lackey!"

Poor “exam-obsessed” university grads:
"Damn it, I spent 10+ years and hundreds of thousands in debt to get a degree, and even being an elite lackey is blocked by nepotism. I have no choice but to become a lowly rider! Screw it! I’ll protest — to the UN if I have to!"

Lowly riders:
"Why do elites make $100k/month while we get $200? Why do they have hundreds of women while we…? Sure, life is slightly better than 200 years ago — phones, motorcycles, a bit of meat — but elites live in villas with yachts, sports cars, beauties, lobsters. Totally unfair! We want higher wages, lower prices, free healthcare and education, transparent elite wealth! Protest, protest, protest!"

During my trip in Indonesia, I asked around:

Most Indonesians dream of being elites — too bad reincarnation odds are slim. They wake up hoping to be lackeys… only to realize they’re lowly riders, and the worst part? They have to support an “exam-obsessed” university grad on top of it. 😅

印尼长期积累的社会矛盾的一次爆发，如果不妥善解决，估计印尼社会和经济会长期的不稳定。因此建议计划投资东南亚的人士，还是要慎重考虑投资印尼的计划。

印尼目前有以下社会问题，且难以解决：

(1)青年人失业率高，虽然印尼整体失业率只有大约4.8%，但青年失业率方面，数据显示：15–24 岁年轻人中的失业率高达 约 16%。年轻人没事干，生活没着落，容易导致社会不稳定。

(2)贫富差距大，收入分配不公正。根据印尼统计局的数字，在2025年初印尼平均月薪仅约309万印尼卢比（不到1500元人民币），但近期要给每个国会议员的每月房租补贴高达5000万印尼卢比（21700元人民币）。

(3)利益集团盘根错节，吸血太狠，普通人无出头之日。现在的印尼总统普拉博沃是印尼第二任总统苏哈托的二女婿（1983年和苏哈托的二女儿蒂蒂克·苏哈托（Titiek Suharto）结婚，1998年离婚），苏哈托统治印尼30多年（1965-1998年，1967-1998年为印尼总统），期间敛财无数（超过百亿美元），杀人如麻（杀害平民超过百万）。

A long-standing buildup of social tensions in Indonesia could erupt at any time. If not properly managed, it could cause prolonged social and economic instability. Investors planning to put money into Southeast Asia should carefully reconsider investments in Indonesia.

Here are some major social issues in Indonesia that are hard to solve:

High youth unemployment:

Overall unemployment is about 4.8%, but among 15–24 year-olds, it’s as high as 16%.

Young people with no work and uncertain futures can easily destabilize society.

Huge wealth gap and unfair income distribution:

The average monthly salary is around 3.09 million IDR (~1,500 CNY).

Meanwhile, MPs receive 50 million IDR (~21,700 CNY) monthly just for housing allowances.

Entrenched interest groups and elite capture:

Ordinary people have little chance to advance.

Current President Prabowo Subianto was married to Suharto’s second daughter (1983–1998).

Suharto ruled Indonesia for over 30 years (1965–1998), amassing billions in wealth and causing mass civilian deaths (over a million).

Bottom line: For investors, Indonesia has potential, but these structural social and political risks cannot be ignored.

During Suharto’s rule:

1965–1967: 500,000–1,000,000 ethnic Chinese killed.

1998: Tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese killed.

East Timor invasion: Tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand East Timorese civilians killed.

Suharto’s regime was marked by extreme violence and mass killings.

By proportion, Suharto’s atrocities in East Timor may have been even worse than Pol Pot’s.

Prabowo, Suharto’s second son-in-law and current Indonesian president, also planned and participated in killings of East Timorese civilians and ethnic Chinese in Indonesia during Suharto’s regime.

Suharto and his cronies were never fully held accountable after stepping down.
Over 20 years later, his former son-in-law, Prabowo, was elected Indonesian president in 2024.

Siti Hediati Hariyadi (born April 14, 1959), commonly known as Titiek Suharto, is an Indonesian entrepreneur and politician. She is the second daughter (fourth child) of Indonesia’s second president, Suharto. Currently, she serves as a member of the Indonesian House of Representatives.
