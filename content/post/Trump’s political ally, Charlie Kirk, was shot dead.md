Charlie Kirk posted videos to his X account moments before he was murdered. This is a breaking news story.

[@hemu-twins](https://www.youtube.com/@hemu-twins) I wasn't a fan of some of Charlie Kirk's views but nobody should be killed over a speech. My condolences to his friends and family 🕊️.

美国总统，政客经常被刺杀，历史上被枪杀的美国总统就有很多位。因为推行新政，利益分配不均被人记恨而报复
</small>
</details>
<div class="translated-text">
U.S. presidents and politicians have often been targeted for assassination; history records several presidents who were shot. This was frequently due to resentment over new policies or perceived unfair distribution of interests, which motivated acts of revenge.

人人持枪才平等？ 美国大量半自动步枪可以从400米的距离射击，找个掩体，哪怕职业军人到死也没法判断射击来源，自从拉斯维加斯音乐节大屠杀以后越来越多的枪手选择远距离射击的方式杀人，怎么反击？？
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Does “everyone being armed” really equalize things? In the U.S., a lot of semi-automatic rifles can shoot accurately from 400 meters. From behind cover, even trained soldiers can’t determine where the shots are coming from. Since the Las Vegas music festival massacre, more shooters have opted for long-distance attacks. How can anyone effectively defend against that?

无论多少人振臂高呼支持你，都不及一粒子弹来得影响大。邦！完了。有鸟兽聚，必有鸟兽散！集会马上结束。降一百次一千次一万次美国国旗，不及禁枪一次。但是，在美国，党派竞争之激烈，难以想象！是不是可以这样说：这世界可以没有美国，但是美国人手中不能没有枪！所以禁枪无望！

No matter how many people cheer in support of you, it can never have the same impact as a single bullet. Bang! That’s it. Where birds and beasts gather, they will disperse! The gathering ends immediately. Lowering the U.S. flag a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times doesn’t compare to passing gun control even once. Yet in the U.S., party competition is unimaginably fierce. Perhaps it can be said: the world could do without the U.S., but Americans cannot be without guns! That’s why gun control is hopeless.

This is what real foolishness looks like: if you want to wear a crown, you have to bear the consequences. That’s the so-called system of checks and balances—not picking a few people and then having everyone kneel. That’s not selecting talent, that’s selecting your own representatives, understand? Of course, a mindset like yours will never grasp this, even in a hundred years. Several U.S. presidents have been assassinated, yet guns weren’t banned—because presidents are human, and without proper security, anyone can be killed. They’re not gods; there are no gods, and there’s no need to kneel.

For this kind of targeted shooting, there’s basically no need to panic—the shooter won’t fire randomly. After the shot, they either flee or get caught. The real danger is when it’s a chaotic, indiscriminate attack, where you have no way to react and don’t even know where the shots are coming from.
