加拿大女歌手席琳·迪翁说：

“乌克兰的胜败将成为人类文明秩序与否的分水岭。乌克兰胜了，文明秩序依然稳固，强权不能破坏规则；乌克兰败了，人类一战二战时期的巨大牺牲付出，将付之东流，人类将回归弱肉强食的丛林社会”。

乌克兰战争从来不是两个国家的领土纠纷那么简单，而对整个国际秩序的维护，一个公平和文明的环境不仅符合正义，也对任何人都有好处。

The war in Ukraine has never been just a simple territorial dispute between two nations. Upholding the entire international order—creating a fair and civilized environment—is not only the right thing to do, but it also benefits everyone.

说的不好听的，因为现有的国际框架秩序最大的维护者就是美国，特别是十几二十年前的美国，二战后他们主导了国际秩序。而且美国二战后的侵略都没有建立在扩大自身领土的基础上进行的，最多就是颠覆政权扶持政权，这至少是相对可以接受的国际秩序了，俄罗斯这个公然侵略并占领他国领土，这完全就是一战二战时甚至之前的国际秩序，还不如美国当警察的时候呢，最混乱的秩序总比无序好。
未来如果我国要去领导国际秩序的话，那么我们也必须要去承担这个国际秩序的捍卫者，也要想二十年前的美国一样，如果一堆的破坏秩序的行为视而不见，那么这个秩序就无法完全构成，那就没有领导力，如果不去领导，那在别国领导的秩序里最大的受益者就是别国，最大的话语权也是别国。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
To put it bluntly, the biggest maintainer of the existing international framework is the United States, especially the U.S. from ten or twenty years ago, which led the international order after WWII. And the U.S.'s post-WWII military actions were never based on expanding its own territory; at most, they involved overthrowing and installing regimes. This, at least, is a relatively acceptable international order. Russia's open invasion and occupation of another country's territory, however, is a return to the international order of WWI, WWII, or even earlier. It's not even as good as when the U.S. was the world's police. A chaotic order is always better than pure chaos.

In the future, if our country wants to lead the international order, we must also assume the role of its defender. We have to be like the U.S. was twenty years ago. If we turn a blind eye to a multitude of actions that violate that order, then the order will never be fully established, and our leadership will be meaningless. If we don't take on the leadership role, then in an order led by other countries, they will be the biggest beneficiaries and hold the most sway.

We should look at this issue **dialectically**. Is it possible that we shouldn't be guided by what might be a flawed Western concept of fairness, civilization, and justice?

Some people have a mindset that when a rich and powerful country attacks another, it's just going there to liberate them. Russia's problem is that it is not a developed country.

Is the sale of oil truly free? Saudi Arabia still has a royal family, so why doesn't the U.S. get involved? It's because Venezuela's oil was nationalized, and it wanted its own pricing power and the right to choose its own trading currency. When other countries sanction you, how can you live well?

美国解体第二天，我立马化身舔美孝子，天天骂俄毛子，并疯狂支持50个美国以各种形式报复俄国。

今天美国解体，明天我就四处去说贝加尔湖的自古以来

当俄罗斯推出《对台湾政策法》，明确将台湾省视作国家，推出《国防授权法案》，给予台湾省军援，捏造中国在新疆的”种 族 灭 绝“谎言，企图分裂我的国家，让中国经历苏联、南斯拉夫、叙利亚、利比亚那样的悲剧，家园化为废墟，人民流离失所，荆棘铜驼，析骨而炊。那时我将像今天反对那些畜生一样反对俄罗斯。

凡基于种花家利益回答该问题的，不管结论如何，立场都没有问题。

凡不基于种花家利益回答该问题的，不是蠢就是坏，亦或既蠢且坏。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The day after the U.S. collapses, I'll immediately become a pro-American loyalist, cursing the Russians every day and frantically supporting the 50 American states in various forms of retaliation against Russia.

If the U.S. collapses today, tomorrow I will go around claiming that Lake Baikal has been ours since ancient times.

When Russia passes a "Taiwan Policy Act" that explicitly treats Taiwan province as a country, introduces a "National Defense Authorization Act" to provide military aid to Taiwan, fabricates lies of "genocide" in Xinjiang in an attempt to split my nation, and puts China through the tragedies of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Syria, and Libya—turning our homeland into ruins, displacing our people, and reducing our land to a place of thistles and cooked bones—I will oppose Russia just as I oppose those animals today.

Anyone who answers this question based on the interests of the Chinese nation has a valid stance, regardless of their conclusion.

Anyone who doesn't answer based on the interests of the Chinese nation is either stupid or evil, or both.

If the U.S. collapses, I will become anti-Russian.

It's that simple. Forget all the insincere nonsense.

说的很到位了，大多数被冠以俄粉称呼的人基本都是这么想的

You've hit the nail on the head. Most people who are labeled as "Russia fans" basically think that way.

乌克兰输了，欧美拿着1700亿美元的欠条来找泽连斯基，泽圣就把乌克兰的土地矿产工厂公司通通的抵债，然后乌克兰老百姓虽然什么都没有了，但是过上了自由民主的幸福生活。然后乌克兰老百姓发现这种幸福生活实在过不下去了，重新民主的选举了一位新总统，合法选举的新总统宣布清算泽圣，土地矿产通通收归国有。然后欧美宣布新总统非法，痛斥乌克兰是个没有民主的独裁政权，全球共讨之，兵临乌克兰，并且把当初给俄罗斯的套餐大礼包给乌克兰完样复制了一份，然后乌克兰有样学样和东方某神秘大国建立起合作没有上限的战略合作伙伴关系。知乎上现在支持乌克兰的正义之士们马上调转枪口也开始对乌克兰的独裁政权不讲法治赖账群起攻之。

After Ukraine loses, the U.S. and Europe come to Saint Zelensky with $170 billion in IOUs. Ze-Sheng then uses all of Ukraine’s land, minerals, factories, and companies as collateral for the debt. So, even though the Ukrainian people are left with nothing, they get to live a happy life of freedom and democracy. Then, the Ukrainian people realize they can’t go on living this happy life, and they democratically elect a new president who legally announces that he will liquidate Saint Zelensky’s agreements and nationalize all the land and minerals. The West then declares the new president illegitimate, denouncing Ukraine as a lawless dictatorship. They rally the world against it, bring their armies to Ukraine’s borders, and give them the exact same sanctions package they originally gave Russia. Following their example, Ukraine establishes a “no-limits” strategic partnership with a certain mysterious great power in the East. And the righteous folks on Zhihu who once supported Ukraine immediately turn their guns and collectively begin to attack Ukraine’s dictatorial regime for its lack of rule of law and for defaulting on its debts.

然后还要大肆吹捧一下世界之光的美国当时怎么怎么善良，帮助乌克兰抵御外敌

And then they must also lavishly praise the U.S., the light of the world, for how incredibly kind it was back then, helping Ukraine fend off an external enemy.

The playbook is always the same. Some people don't get it, or they pretend not to.

给欧美外企打工难道不是比给乌克兰本土企业打工好吗？
欧美外企出口额难道不是比乌克兰本土企业出口额多吗？
欧美外企交税难道不是比乌克兰本土企业交税多吗？
老板是欧美人还是乌克兰人就那么重要吗？
归根结底不还是看怎么收税和使用税收吗？

Isn't working for a European or American foreign company better than working for a local Ukrainian company?

And isn't the export volume of European or American foreign companies greater than that of local Ukrainian companies?

Don't European or American foreign companies pay more taxes than local Ukrainian companies?

Is it really that important whether the boss is European, American, or Ukrainian?

Doesn't it all come down to how taxes are collected and used?

战争经费都是毛子出的，欧美冻结了俄的海外资产，达到6千多亿美刀，现在已经立法把这钱移交乌克兰，用于军费和财产损失赔偿，可以讲是毛子自己出钱打自己，当然它也可以找它干儿子要钱

All the war funding comes from Russia, as Europe and the U.S. have frozen over $600 billion of Russia's overseas assets. Legislation has now been passed to transfer this money to Ukraine to be used for military spending and reparations for property damage.

It can be said that Russia is paying to fight itself. Of course, it could also ask its adopted son for money.
