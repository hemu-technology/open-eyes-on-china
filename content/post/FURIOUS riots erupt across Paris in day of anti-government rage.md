Protesters clashed with police early on Wednesday in Paris, where garbage bins were set on fire and teargas apparently used by police. The French government deployed an exceptional 80,000 police in response to a day of nationwide action under the slogan “Block Everything.” The demonstrators, angry at French President Emmanuel Macron over his leadership and austerity policies, are planning to disrupt activity across the country.

The Paris police prefecture said 75 people had already been detained by 9am, with demonstrations and blockades expected to continue throughout the day. Across the country, an estimated 200 people had been detained by 10am BST. In Rennes, on the outskirts of the capital, a bus was set on fire, with dramatic footage circulated on social media. Two days after François Bayrou was ousted as prime minister in a parliamentary confidence vote and replaced on Tuesday by Sébastien Lecornu, thousands of protesters responded to online calls to disrupt the country. One, posting on X, warned: "Emmanuel Macron, if he keeps mocking the French people, he end up like Kennedy or Louis XVI."

It’s not just France — the whole of Europe is facing this problem. The contradiction between high welfare and a sluggish economy is irreconcilable.

一个明智的统治者应该懂得如何给民众适度的自由以宣泄其内心的痛苦与不满———只要这种宣泄不至于太夸张或太放肆。因为，压抑体液或是捂住伤口不让脓血流出的做法只会使身上长出更多的恶疮和毒瘤。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
A wise ruler should know how to grant the people a measured degree of freedom to vent their inner pain and dissatisfaction — as long as this expression doesn’t become too extreme or unruly. Suppressing bodily fluids or covering wounds to stop the pus from flowing only leads to more abscesses and tumors forming in the body.

感觉法国发生这种事都很正常，之前马克龙延期退休，感觉全法都闹翻天了，最后也不了了之。法国属于是把大招当平A用了，大家都习惯了，也就没危害了。

还得是尼泊尔厉害呀，不论是否在野执政，统一都烧了。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It seems that such events in France are quite normal. Previously, when Macron postponed the retirement age, it felt like the whole country was in uproar — and in the end, it just fizzled out. France seems to treat big moves like ordinary actions; people are used to it, so it doesn’t cause much harm.

Nepal, on the other hand, is really something — whether in power or not, they went all out and burned everything.

就看这运动接下来后续发展。就可以验证有没有颜色革命，有没有深层政府引导民粹运动，有其他外部势力干涉了。下一步这火到底是攻克巴士底狱推翻法国君主统治，革命老区传统了，还是在某些社交平台留出法国权贵内部黑幕，以及家庭住址了。把火燃到议会老爷家了！去老爷家瞧一瞧看一看，天宫一角到底什么样子的！

</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It’s worth watching how this movement develops next. It could reveal whether there’s a color revolution, whether the deep state is guiding populist movements, or whether other external forces are interfering. The next step will show whether this fire will reach the level of storming the Bastille and overthrowing the French monarchy — keeping with revolutionary traditions — or if it’s just exposing the secrets and home addresses of French elites on certain social platforms. Let the fire reach the parliamentarians’ homes! Go see for yourself what a corner of their “palace” really looks like!

正常，上上街，举举旗，喊两声，法国操碎心人士日常。

不上街，显的政治不正确。

遥想当年，存在主义萨特和第六感伏波娃堪称街头斗士，以街为家。

街角旮旯的咖啡屋是法国小资们理想之所，也是美国文艺范伍迪艾伦梦想乌托邦。

被批为没思想，没灵魂的群体。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
As usual — take to the streets, wave a few flags, shout a bit — just another day for France’s political worriers.

If you don’t go out, you’re seen as politically incorrect.

Thinking back, existentialist Sartre and Sixth Sense Beauvoir were true street fighters, making the streets their home.

The corner cafés are the ideal spots for France’s petit bourgeois, and the dreamlike utopia for American artistic types like Woody Allen.

They were criticized as a group lacking thought and soul.

可以不上班，但高福利，和假期不能减。 真是佩服这些靠殖民和掠夺维持了数百年高福利的国家，面对着全球觉醒，很难再靠殖民和掠夺后何以为继？ 政府入不敷出，但要动一下国民的福利，哈哈，那就死给你看。 这种情况只会愈演愈烈， 这类国家的命运也到了悬崖边。

You can skip work, but high welfare and holidays cannot be cut. Truly impressive are these countries that maintained high welfare for centuries through colonization and plunder. Now, facing a globally awakened world, how can they continue relying on past exploitation? The government is running a deficit, but try to touch citizens’ welfare — haha, they’ll show you death. This situation will only escalate, and the fate of such countries is now teetering on the edge of a cliff.

小马政治上没有头脑，战略上没有远见，却想挤上饭桌，与法国历史上其他总统差太远了，最后只能进历史拉圾堆

Little Macron lacks political savvy and strategic foresight, yet he tries to squeeze into the table of power. Compared to other French presidents in history, he falls far short and will ultimately end up in the dustbin of history.

French 🇫🇷 farmers, workers, and schoolchildren — stay strong and keep going! Support and thanks. Macron wants to send them to fight in Ukraine 🇺🇦, their whole families could go, but the money meant for farmers, workers, and schoolchildren must not go to Ukraine 🇺🇦. France 🇫🇷, stay strong — we support you. You are truly great!

法国人的浪漫不仅表现在生活上，街头闹事也体现的淋漓尽致，这美丽的风景线就是爱自由，爱民主，爱浪漫的法兰西人的完美释放。

The French love of romance isn’t just seen in daily life — it’s vividly expressed in their street protests as well. This beautiful scene is the perfect expression of the French people’s love for freedom, democracy, and romance.

马克龙自认自己手里有权，想怎么用就怎么用，完全忽视民意，民众把他没法，只能用这种粗暴的方式来发泄他们对小马的不满。
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Macron believes he holds all the power and can use it however he wants, completely ignoring public opinion. The people feel powerless and can only vent their dissatisfaction with him in this rough manner.

资本主义走到了尽头，长时间的累积下贫富差距太大了，老百姓不造反才怪

Capitalism has reached its limits. After prolonged accumulation, the wealth gap has become enormous — it’s no wonder ordinary people are revolting.
