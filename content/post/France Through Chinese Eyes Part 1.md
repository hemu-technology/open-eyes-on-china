France’s economy isn’t on Germany’s level, its global influence feels weaker than the UK’s (just my take), and compared to the US it’s not even close. People like to poke fun at France a lot, but it still acts with this “big power” mindset, even daring to push back against the US. To me, it feels like its ambition is bigger than its actual strength.

  <strong style="color: #0077b8;">Overview:</strong><br>
Let’s take a look at how Chinese netizens view France. Overall, many Chinese people hold a positive attitude toward France, and quite a few express genuine goodwill toward the country.

Since the volume of comments is quite large, I’ve decided to publish them in several parts. Below are translations of posts taken from the Chinese equivalent of Quora. I haven’t filtered them based on personal preference, and I’ve tried to keep the translations as fair and unbiased as possible.

You’re also welcome to share your own thoughts on China in the comments. If you do, I can translate them into Chinese and post them on Chinese forums so that more people there can see how you view China.

在法国最大的感受，气候太舒适了。

虽然我也学过地理，但从没有人告诉我巴黎的夏天晚上十点半天才黑。

这种感觉之美妙，如果五点下班，感觉比东半球多拥有了一个下午。我甚至怀疑启蒙思想就是在这样的气候条件下产生的。

南法虽然热点，但这边的人活得太松弛了，来了南法你才知道为什么迪卡侬会出现在法国，这在日本就是全家。

我是坚定的地理论决定者，比如我认为热带气候是很难产生高阶文明的，人需要花大量的精力散发热量，留给思考的能量就要少很多。巴黎那地儿的气候，冬暖夏凉，冬短夏长，适合发呆+谈恋爱，气候是浪漫的基础。蒙特利尔再法式也不浪漫，你总不能每天在地下城约会吧，你在街边放个小桌子喝咖啡试试。

国内的户外活动窗口期其实很短，夏天有三个月跟火炉似的，冬天有两个月跟冰窖似的，还有台风洪涝的等例行自然灾害，每年都要来那么几次，也就春秋短暂的几周会愿意亲近大自然。

从巴黎坐高铁到马赛，竖跨整个法国，一站没停，一路几乎全是平原，简直天选之地。拥有这样一个地理位置的地方，想落后都难。

世界总是有bug的，如果没有中美俄，法国就是地球上最好的地方。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
My biggest impression of France is how incredibly comfortable the climate is.

I studied geography, but nobody ever told me that in Paris, the summer sun doesn’t set until around 10:30 p.m. That feeling is amazing—if you get off work at 5, it feels like you suddenly have an extra afternoon compared to the Eastern Hemisphere. I even wonder if Enlightenment thought itself was born out of such pleasant weather.

The south of France may be hot, but people there live with such ease and relaxation. It’s only when you visit that you realize why Decathlon was born in France—kind of like how convenience stores are everywhere in Japan.

I’m a firm believer in geographic determinism. For example, I think it’s hard for advanced civilizations to emerge in tropical climates—people have to spend so much energy cooling down that there’s less left for thinking. Paris, on the other hand, has mild winters and cool summers, with short winters and long summers. Perfect for daydreaming and falling in love—the climate itself lays the foundation for romance. Montreal may be French in spirit, but it’s not romantic. You can’t go on dates in an underground city every day, and good luck putting a little table out on the street for coffee there.

In China, the window for outdoor activities is actually quite short. Summers are like a furnace for three months, winters are like an icehouse for two, and then you still have typhoons, floods, and other “regular” natural disasters hitting every year. It’s really only during the brief weeks of spring and autumn that people want to get close to nature.

Taking the high-speed train from Paris to Marseille, crossing the whole country without a single stop, it’s almost all plains. Truly a land blessed by nature. With a geography like that, it would be hard not to flourish.

The world has its “bugs.” If it weren’t for the US, China, and Russia, France would probably be the best place on Earth.

Winter is cold pretty much everywhere. A city’s climate doesn’t need to follow the “wooden-barrel theory”—what I like is when the “long plank” is really long. Take Canada as the opposite example: when half the year feels like winter, it’s hard to fall in love with the place.

不不，法国冬天不冷，而是湿冷加阴风阵阵，三度给你整出零下五度体感，而是漫长，有年五月我去巴黎给我冻得满街找围巾。除了南法，法国平原基本和德国英国荷比卢气候一样，都是夏天像天堂漫长冬天让人想死的货色
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
No, no—you’ve got it wrong. French winters aren’t “not cold”; they’re damp and bone-chilling, with icy winds that make 3°C feel like minus 5. And they drag on forever. One year I went to Paris in May and was shivering so badly I had to scour the streets for a scarf.

Apart from the south, most of France’s plains share the same climate as Germany, the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands—heavenly summers, but winters so long and miserable they make you want to die.

North Korea isn’t exactly weak, and East Germany was actually quite strong. Are you trying to blame it on political systems? Compare North Korea with India—who comes out ahead? East Germany versus Haiti—who’s stronger? Geography determines the people, and the people determine the ceiling of civilization.

By geographic determinism, we’re talking about how indigenous peoples’ civilizations developed within their natural environments. When considering the New World, this really only applies to the pre-Columbian era. For example, why didn’t the Americas develop feudal societies? Geography alone can perfectly explain it.

Harbin uses Beijing time, so in December it gets dark around 4 p.m. (though correspondingly, it gets light around 7 a.m.). In France, sunrise is after 8 a.m., and it gets dark around 5 p.m.

For someone with a typical work schedule, I feel it’s psychologically more comfortable if it gets dark around 5:30 or 6. Otherwise, seeing the sun set at 2 or 3 p.m. while it’s still freezing outside makes you not want to do anything 🤦‍♂️

如果今天你们不站在我们这一边，当明天你站在我这个位置的时候，你的身边将空无一人。

起初他们追杀社会主义者，

我没有说话，

因为我不是社会主义者；

后来他们追杀工会成员，

我没有说话，

接着他们追杀犹太人，

我没有说话，

*"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."*

She should be grateful she was in France.

Americans aren’t born this way. They’re taught to present themselves as the “people on the mountaintop” in formal settings, but in practice, their behavior is often petty and self-serving. If you don’t dig too deep, everything seems bright, sunny, and straightforward—but once you start to explore and understand, it’s a chaotic world of monsters and predation. Try telling this to those around you, and they won’t believe you; then you turn around and it feels like their faces have turned into demons, baring fangs. It’s no wonder Americans have such a fascination with Lovecraftian fiction.

Because there are so many people, resources are limited, so the proportion who receive higher education is low. That means only a few are conscious and daring enough to act, while the majority either stay silent or oppose you, making it much harder to unite and persuade them.

The last major social experiment: the Germans planned it, the French implemented it, the Russians produced it, and in the end, the Chinese maintained and updated it.

For a country like that, the very least you can do is show basic respect.

What you call “Black” people in France are actually from North Africa; their race is the same as the French—they’re Caucasian.

其实吧也别太为法国的种族问题担忧，人家一整个后花园呢，地方大多了难有特别大的地盘冲突，白人不会被排挤完的。而且这个世界还是靠白人的头脑更好维持秩序，足球上也是一样，光靠几个黑又硬没用，必须得有白人指挥官统筹，人家其实搭配相得益彰
</small>
</details>
<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Honestly, there’s no need to worry too much about France’s racial issues. They have a huge “backyard,” so there’s rarely any major territorial conflict, and White people won’t be completely pushed out.

Besides, the world still relies more on White people’s brains to maintain order. The same goes for football—just having a few strong Black players isn’t enough; you need White commanders to coordinate. The combination actually works quite well.

The essence of a bourgeois revolution is human liberation, and the essence of a proletarian revolution is also human liberation. First, it pursues political equality; then it pursues economic equality. The latter stage is a continuation of the former.

艺术：德拉克洛瓦、莫奈、雷诺阿、马蒂斯、圣桑、德彪西、弗兰克

思想：伏尔泰、卢梭、孟德斯鸠、帕斯卡尔、狄德罗

我以上列出的这些人，可以说如果人类历史缺少了他们，世界绝不会像现在这样精彩纷繁、人类文明也许将倒退好几百年。

于法国爆发的启蒙运动更是将民主和自由的思想传遍了整个欧洲乃至世界，成为一种仿若“公共契约”般的社会共识，法国大革命则为欧洲资产阶级的胜利奠定了基础。

此外，第一个无产阶级政权——巴黎公社也是在法国建立的，法国一向被誉为“革命的摇篮”。

可以说这个国家的存在对全人类而言都不可或缺，世界上的绝大多数国家就算从历史上抹除也不会对现代社会造成什么影响，只有少数几个国家有影响现代文明的实力，法国就是其中之一。

所以别老逮着个二战投降的事就觉得这是个废物民族，如果法国不存在的话你可能连敲键盘乳法的机会都没有，而且一战凡尔登战役法国死了55万人，喷子们怎么就选择性失忆了呢？还是说喷子们的文化水平也就知道个二战了？

I only know these:

Physics: Ampère, Pascal, de Broglie, Dufay, Marie Curie, Becquerel, Coulomb

Chemistry: Lavoisier, Vauquelin, Peltier, Berthollet, Moissan, Berthelot, Le Chatelier

Literature: Hugo, Maupassant, Balzac, Dumas, Flaubert, Romain Rolland, Daudet, Verne, Proust

Art: Delacroix, Monet, Renoir, Matisse, Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Franck

Thought: Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Pascal, Diderot

All of these people I listed above — if human history had lacked them, the world would never have been as colorful and diverse as it is now, and human civilization might have regressed by centuries.

The Enlightenment that erupted in France spread the ideas of democracy and freedom across Europe and even the whole world, becoming a kind of “social contract” as common consensus. The French Revolution laid the foundation for the victory of the European bourgeoisie.

Moreover, the first proletarian regime — the Paris Commune — was also established in France. France has long been known as the “cradle of revolutions.”
![](images/2025/france-revolution.webp ())
One can say that this country’s existence is indispensable to all humanity. The majority of countries in the world could be erased from history without changing modern society much, but only a handful of nations have truly shaped modern civilization — and France is one of them.

So stop clinging to the “surrender in WWII” trope as if that makes it a worthless nation. If France didn’t exist, you probably wouldn’t even have the chance to sit here typing away, mocking it. And let’s not forget: in WWI, France lost 550,000 lives in the Battle of Verdun alone. Funny how the haters conveniently forget that — or maybe their “education level” never got them past WWII in the first place.

文学的话法国肯定还得加个普鲁斯特，另外法国这个国家在这方面不仅是出了不少名作和名作家，还在许多更深刻的地方影响了全球，古老一些的有莫里哀拉伯雷那一代对欧洲文化的影响，近一些的比较文学这个学科都是一百年前法国发育出来的，是他们第一次把抬起头看世界文学而不是只会研究本民族的文学这种思路变成一个正规成体系的学科。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
In terms of literature, France definitely deserves to have Proust added to the list. But beyond just producing great works and great writers, the country has influenced the world in much deeper ways. Going back further, figures like Molière and Rabelais shaped European culture as a whole. More recently, even the discipline of comparative literature itself was developed in France about a century ago — they were the first to formalize the idea of looking at world literature as a whole instead of limiting research to one’s own national tradition.

虽然但是，索绪尔是祖籍在法国吧()说来挺有意思，上世纪索绪尔为代表的结构主义在法国多个领域都有影响，比如数学布尔巴基，甚至文学也掀起了一股这样的新潮流
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Sure, Saussure’s roots were technically French, but what’s really interesting is how structuralism—kickstarted by him—swept through so many fields in France during the 20th century. You see it in math with Bourbaki, and even in literature, where it sparked a whole new wave of ideas.

二战法国选择错了吗？二战注定是美苏与德日之间的最终对决，法国🇫🇷处在最前线，凭什么拿自己吧百万民众生命去做炮灰。早点让路，已最小的损失换区最终的胜利，法国战略绝对正确啊！
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Did France make the wrong choice in WWII? The war was ultimately destined to be a showdown between the US, the USSR, and Germany–Japan. France 🇫🇷 was on the front lines—why risk millions of its own people as cannon fodder? By yielding early, France minimized losses and preserved lives for eventual victory. Strategically, France’s decision was absolutely correct!

嗯，我们处于亚洲战线的最前线，东北应该放弃，战略绝对正确，北方、南方也应该放弃……等等，这个好像是汪精卫的主张，你是不是觉得他的主张才是正确的？

Yes, we’re on the front line of the Asian theater; giving up the Northeast would be strategically correct, the north and south should be abandoned too… Wait a minute, that sounds like Wang Jingwei’s position. Are you saying his approach would have been right?

If we acted like France, what would have happened to the Soviet Union? To Britain? To the US?
And then, what would have happened to us?

You all are so short-sighted—why do you only look at isolated points instead of reasoning through the bigger picture?

The “quiet war” of 1940 wasted a whole year.

In 1941, they were hit by a complete surprise attack and suffered heavy losses.

Domestically, there was infighting—the resistance was crushed (basically like Wang Jingwei overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek).

It’s not that there was no will to resist; most of those who wanted to were crushed.

Those who escaped formed Free France and Fighting France, and they continued to resist.

English is basically a “European pidgin”; you could even call it the Japanese of Europe. About 90% of the more advanced vocabulary comes from French, the rest mostly from Greek, and everyday words are largely related to Germanic roots. The native Old English portion is maybe 10%—and that’s generous.

安茹的查理是路易九世的幼弟,在中世纪他军事扩张到了现今阿尔巴尼亚杜拉斯地区，加冕为了阿尔巴尼亚国王，不过第三代之后卡佩安茹家族似乎就没使用这个国王头衔了，该地区的领主就称为杜拉佐公爵，统治了100年左右。
</small>
</details>
<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Charles of Anjou was the younger brother of Louis IX. In the Middle Ages, he expanded militarily into what is now the Durrës region of Albania and was crowned King of Albania. However, after the third generation, the Capet-Anjou family seems to have stopped using the royal title, and the local rulers were known as the Dukes of Durazzo, governing the area for roughly a century.
