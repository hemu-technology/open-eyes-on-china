The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has announced the launch of a new Section 301 investigation into China’s implementation of the Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, originally signed in January 2020 between Washington and Beijing.

According to USTR, the probe will assess whether China has fulfilled its obligations under the Phase One deal — particularly in areas such as intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, and financial services — and determine whether Beijing’s actions have placed undue burdens or restrictions on U.S. commerce.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the move highlights the Trump Administration’s continued effort to “hold China accountable” and ensure a fair and reciprocal trade relationship.

> “President Trump made history when he brokered the Phase One Agreement to stand up for American workers,” Greer said. “This investigation reinforces our commitment to protecting U.S. farmers, ranchers, and innovators, while ensuring China lives up to its promises.”

Despite repeated U.S. efforts to address compliance concerns, USTR said that five years after the agreement took effect, China has failed to meet several commitments, including reducing non-tariff barriers and expanding market access for U.S. goods and services.

Under the Trade Act of 1974, the USTR is authorized to initiate Section 301 investigations when a foreign country’s trade practices appear to violate or undermine U.S. rights under an existing trade agreement. The agency will invite public comments on the issue and hold a public hearing on December 16, 2025, to gather further input.

More information and official documents related to the investigation are available on the USTR’s website.

只要稀土不开放，就掐住了美国脖子，特别是军工，就算他们重建只需要5年，但这5年怎么办？军事设备全部停下来，那些军事复合体大部分都去喝西北风？可能吗？中国可能只需要这5年时间，一切都可能发生。

If China keeps its rare-earth exports restricted, it could choke off the U.S.—especially its defense industry. Even if the U.S. could rebuild supply lines within five years, what would happen in the meantime? If weapons production grinds to a halt, many defense contractors would be left stranded. Could that actually occur? China might only need a five-year window — and in that time, a lot could change.

The United States has no shortage of military technology, but it does lack high-purity rare earth materials. At present, the U.S. lacks the capability to refine rare earths to the same standards as China — and even with major efforts, it could take a decade or more to catch up, if ever.

That’s the right approach! Keep leveraging rare earths, focus on domestic development, have tech companies serve the people, and raise the standard of living.

不要指望贸易交火一两次就一劳永逸，在中、美经济实力未分出高低、上下之前的若干年内，中、美贸易磨磨擦擦将为常态。不要大惊小怪，要保持一个客观、理性、平常的心态！ 我们要做的是:规划好我们的贸易行为，作好应对对美国贸易变化的准备，让我们的企业、公司、工厂生产应对灵活，手段多样，不要死盯美国市场，要开始转向，贸易可作、也可不作，规避对美国贸易风险。

Don’t assume that a single trade clash or two will resolve everything permanently. In the coming years, until the economic balance between China and the U.S. is clearer, trade frictions are likely to remain the norm. Stay objective, rational, and composed. The key is to carefully plan our trade activities, prepare for shifts in U.S. trade policies, ensure our companies and factories can adapt quickly, and avoid relying solely on the U.S. market. Diversification is essential — trading with the U.S. is optional, and risks should be managed.

对付美帝国高额关税唯一办法就是，先预收全额货款，同时对等额度提高出口税，比如目前收45%关税，我们出口时就收取45%出口税，对方征多少就收多少，反正美帝的报价是中国厂家的5-40倍，空间足够大。并让全球免税充分享受中国制造的红利
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
One practical response to steep U.S. tariffs is to require full advance payment and impose matching export duties. If the U.S. applies a 45% tariff, we would impose a 45% export tax — mirror their levy exactly. Given that U.S. markups can be five to forty times Chinese factory prices, there’s ample margin to do this. Meanwhile, we could open duty‑free access for other markets so the rest of the world can fully benefit from Chinese manufacturing.

U.S.–China trade has largely been about exchanging China’s inexpensive, high‑quality goods for American dollars — but the U.S. doesn’t actually sell what China needs. The tech they export is often deliberately limited and outrageously priced. That trade model needs to change. Decoupling isn’t something to fear. Some argue China should stop buying patents and stop treating foreign IP as sacrosanct — flooding the market with locally made copies, they say, could undermine America’s high‑tech advantage.

On one hand, the U.S. backs Ukraine against Russia; on the other, it buys oil from Russia, effectively supporting them. Aren’t they behaving even more foolishly than simpletons?

不管如何，美国的社会结构是更合理的。
产业代表、政府代表、决策机制、对外政策制定算是比较明确的，值得肯定的

Overall, the U.S. has a relatively rational social structure. Its industry and government representatives, decision-making processes, and foreign policy formulation are fairly clear — something worth acknowledging.

美国人最NB 的一点就是不内耗，生活差了永远都是想办法整别的国家的企业和资本，而中国人过的差了老是要整自己国家的企业和资本，差距太大了
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
What’s most striking about Americans is their lack of internal conflict. When times are hard, they focus on foreign enterprises and capital. In China, however, hardship often leads to targeting domestic companies and resources. The difference is stark.

To some extent, that’s true — there’s a distinction between exploiting foreign versus domestic resources. But in practice, it’s not that there’s no will; the conditions just aren’t there. It’s an inherent contradiction. [facepalm]

Manufacturing returning to the U.S. is unrealistic unless tariffs rise enough to match the extra labor costs of American workers. Even then, it’s unclear whether American consumers could handle such soaring prices for everyday goods.

> The U.S. decision to reactivate Section 301 is unlikely to yield clear winners. While intended to address perceived trade imbalances or intellectual property issues, in practice it raises costs for both sides and disrupts supply chains. American companies and consumers may face higher prices, while Chinese exporters encounter added barriers—illustrating that such unilateral measures are disadvantageous to all parties.
> 
> China, however, is well-prepared. Over the years, it has strengthened domestic industries, diversified supply chains, and built resilience against external shocks, making it less vulnerable to punitive actions. At the same time, global trade increasingly relies on cooperation and multilateral frameworks, and unilateral tariffs risk undermining trust, triggering retaliation, and fragmenting markets.
> 
> Ultimately, Section 301 may provide short-term leverage for the U.S., but it is unlikely to solve underlying trade issues. Instead, constructive dialogue and coordinated approaches remain the more sustainable path for global commerce.
