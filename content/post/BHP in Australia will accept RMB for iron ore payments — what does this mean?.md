> **Trade and Settlement Convenience:** BHP’s acceptance of RMB means that Chinese importers can pay for iron ore directly in RMB, without having to convert through the U.S. dollar, reducing transaction costs and currency risk.
>
> **RMB Internationalization:** This is another example of the RMB being used in commodity trade, highlighting its growing role in global commerce.
>
> **China-Australia Economic Ties:** It strengthens economic dependence and cooperation between China and Australia, and could, to some extent, impact the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the iron ore market.

> **Impact on Financial Markets:** Increased RMB payments may drive the development of RMB-related financial products, such as the offshore RMB market and RMB-denominated bonds.

我还记得当年欧元刚成立抢美元的饭碗，美帝就直接发动战争，轰炸南联盟，阻击欧元。

我还记得伊拉克的萨达姆要用欧元来结算石油贸易，美帝就用一小瓶洗衣粉做借口，灭了萨达姆政权，杀了萨达姆一家。

我还记得利比亚的卡扎菲要在非洲成立非元结算石油贸易，美帝又是那一套，灭杀了卡扎菲政权。

现在中国要搞能源，矿产，粮食的人民币结算体系。美帝你怎么就不做声了，不敢发动战争了？这可是在挖你美帝的根啊，你就眼睁睁看着人民币蚕食着美元的地盘份额？

美帝你敢不敢动手啊！不敢动就赶紧滚回美洲去做你的门罗主义去，撤出第一第二岛链的军事力量，太平洋足够大，容得下中美。
{{< /headingorig >}}

I still remember when the euro was first introduced, threatening the dollar’s dominance—what did the U.S. do? It directly launched a war, bombing Yugoslavia to block the euro.

I remember when Saddam Hussein wanted to settle oil trades in euros, the U.S. used a flimsy pretext—a little bottle of laundry detergent—to topple him and wipe out his regime.

I remember when Gaddafi tried to establish an African currency to trade oil outside the dollar, the U.S. did the same thing, destroying his regime.

Now China is trying to build an RMB-based system for energy, minerals, and grain settlements. And the U.S.? Silent. Not daring to start a war. This is striking at the very root of the dollar, yet they just stand by and watch the RMB nibble away at the dollar’s share.

So, U.S., do you dare to act? If not, just go back to the Americas and stick to your Monroe Doctrine—withdraw your military forces from the First and Second Island Chains. The Pacific is big enough for both China and the U.S.

Of course. Back then, the only country that could really challenge the U.S. was the Soviet Union — and it eventually collapsed on its own. After that, the U.S. could start wars whenever it wanted. Those were the good old days for Americans, weren’t they?

Some might argue that the U.S. has indeed fought strong opponents — for instance, during the Korean War in the early 1950s, when American-led UN forces clashed with Chinese troops supporting North Korea. The war ended in a stalemate, leading to the armistice agreement of 1953, which still defines the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula today.

The United States, as the world’s postwar superpower, largely benefited from the victories of China — the main force against Japan — and the Soviet Union — the main force against Germany.

Not the same in size, but the threat was huge.

The gap in strength was indeed huge, but with the Soviets looming nearby, China couldn’t act freely at first. Later, after some strategic alliances were leveraged, Soviet support and air power were in place. The mountainous terrain of Korea made heavy artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles hard to maneuver. The “18-nation coalition” ended up looking like they were at a prisoner-of-war Olympics, which must have left them wide-eyed. 😏 I’m really curious who would have taken gold back then!

{{< translation>}}
I think history books should have been rewritten long ago. They all follow a Western narrative — “discovering the New World” should be erased, and Indigenous peoples should be properly acknowledged. The same goes for Australia; people are made to think it was founded by Europeans. And the explanations for why Northern Europeans have high noses — supposedly to warm the air they breathe — are just nonsense.

The U.S. essentially acted early with a form of biological warfare during the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial virus seemed targeted at East Asians, and in the early days in Wuhan, there were all kinds of restrictions and pre-planned information campaigns.

The first stage is Taiwan. Wasn’t the huge recall there basically meant to mobilize for war? It was immediately shut down.

我说的就是下克上的事。要想克，首先得有那么个基础，一个阶层团体，抱着一个信念，得有目标有依靠，现在它没有依靠，只有绝望。以前能发生下克上，是因为那时日本工业化完成了，水平还不低，对周围国家形成碾压优势，这是它的依靠，目标虽难，但是那个优势是它赖以实现目标的基础，是本钱。现在它没有优势，眼看被别人碾压，拿啥来攒够一个坚定的团体呢？不排除某几个人头脑发热独走，比如某个军舰、飞机的控制人自杀冲锋制造事件，但是不能左右大势。
{{< translation>}}
What I’m talking about is exactly gekokujō — the lower overthrowing the higher. To pull it off, you first need a foundation: a cohesive group with a shared belief, clear objectives, and some form of support. Right now, Japan has none of that — only despair.

In the past, gekokujō was possible because Japan had completed its industrialization. Its capabilities were strong enough to dominate neighboring countries, providing the basis and leverage to achieve its goals. Today, without such an advantage and facing obvious pressure from others, how could it possibly build a committed group?

Of course, some individuals might act rashly — for example, a ship or aircraft commander going rogue — but such isolated actions cannot change the overall trend.

Either way it’s a dead end. The “Wise King” — looking out for his own gain — would happily spill a lot of little Japan’s blood. If the pro‑U.S. faction wins and actually follows his playbook, Japan won’t just suffer another “lost decade” — it’ll be finished for good; the tiny bit of industry it has left would be wrecked, and Japan would live off tourism and the adult‑entertainment industry, a playground for Chinese and American men. If the pragmatists win, fine — the U.S. would move to take them out first; their balls would be in someone else’s grip.

因为军队装备有代差了，虽然没打过，但是演习都能看出来的，而且美国的工业也无法支持同最大工业国的战争，就拿海军来算，美国造一艘，对方造两百艘，无论人口还是意志都无法相比，还有大量的无人装备，这仗无论如何都打不赢，现实和游戏都是一样的[害羞]
{{< translation>}}
Because of the technological gap in military equipment, even without actual combat, exercises already show the difference. The U.S. industrial base also can’t support a war against the largest industrial power. Take the navy as an example: the U.S. builds one ship, while the other side builds two hundred. Neither population nor resolve can compare, and there’s also a huge amount of unmanned equipment. No matter how you look at it, this war can’t be won — reality and games are the same in this regard. 😳

还是钱的问题，大伙有钱分的时候那点烂事还能扔一边，没钱的时候就是各种吃相难看，谁也不想让利，史密斯专员能少拿点吗？军工集团能少拿点吗？都不能，那就只能找个肥羊。美国国内现在的各种乱象也是因为钱不够分，前几十年钱太太太好挣了
{{< translation>}}
It still comes down to money. When there’s plenty to share, those little problems can be ignored. When there isn’t, everyone shows their ugly side — no one wants to give up any share. Could Commissioner Smith take less? Could the military‑industrial complex take less? Nope. So they have to find a fat target. The chaos in the U.S. today is also because there isn’t enough money to go around; in the past few decades, making money was way, way too easy.

你觉得伊朗被制裁了几十年，又是老钟的第一供油国，他用啥结算？用美元不早就被冻结了吗？患有沙特，中沙石油和导弹飞机的交易用啥结算？傻瓜都知道石油美元早就岌岌可危了。要不以色列能杀红了眼？
{{< translation>}}
Think about it — Iran has been under sanctions for decades and is China’s top oil supplier. How do they settle payments? Using dollars would have long been frozen. What about Saudi Arabia, and the oil, missile, and aircraft deals between China and Saudi Arabia? Any fool can see that the petrodollar has been on shaky ground for a long time. Otherwise, would Israel be going this crazy?

委内瑞拉国防部长洛佩斯于2025年10月4日公开宣布，该国防空系统在距海岸约75公里的空域发现了5架美军F-35隐身战机。

委内瑞拉不像大家一开始想象的那么好捏，美国是真的没有信心。
{{< translation>}}
On October 4, 2025, Venezuela’s Defense Minister, López, publicly announced that the country’s air defense system detected five U.S. F‑35 stealth fighters about 75 km off its coast.

Venezuela isn’t as easy to pressure as many initially thought — the U.S. truly lacks confidence.

当然容得下，只是这个世界现在并不正常。

广大非洲、美洲、亚洲都被压迫着，别以为我是在唱高调。

非洲如尼日尔的铀矿被法国拿捏（但法国被逼走了）；

南美如巴西，土地被大资本牢牢掌控，卢拉哭诉民众都吃不饱饭；

甚至美国人自己的底层百姓每年都有大量营养不良，饿死的。
{{< translation>}}
Of course there’s room, it’s just that the world isn’t functioning normally right now.

Across Africa, the Americas, and Asia, people are being oppressed — and I’m not exaggerating.

In Africa, uranium mines in Niger are controlled by France (though they were eventually forced out).
In South America, like Brazil, land is tightly controlled by big capital, and President Lula laments that many citizens can’t even get enough to eat.
Even in the U.S., a large number of poor people suffer from malnutrition every year, with some dying of hunger.

老美现在也是烽烟四起，俄乌，中东，亚太，拉美（委内瑞拉），这四处又到处有老中的影子，老美还真的不敢拿RMB说事。上个月小日子高桥竞选前的硬话早就变成了软语，小日子也没那么笨，只想当棋子不想当棋盘。

The U.S. is currently facing fires everywhere — Russia–Ukraine, the Middle East, Asia‑Pacific, and Latin America (Venezuela) — all with China’s influence visible. The U.S. really doesn’t dare make an issue out of the RMB. Last month, the tough talk from Japan’s Takahashi before the election has already softened. Japan isn’t that foolish — it just wants to be a chess piece, not the chessboard.

整体和局部、长期与短期，主要与次要，都要具体情况具体分析，川普做的到底是符合美国的长期利益，还是有利于他短期的利益，我也不清楚。大家共同探讨。两党轮换有好有坏，政策调整变换，或者自动纠错，咱也说不清。

{{< translation >}}
When it comes to the big picture versus local concerns, long-term versus short-term, primary versus secondary, everything needs to be analyzed case by case. I’m not sure whether what Trump is doing truly serves America’s long-term interests or just his short-term gains. It’s something for everyone to discuss. The alternating of the two parties has its pros and cons, policies shift and adjust, or even self-correct — we can’t say for certain.

You often say “I don’t know” or “it’s unclear,” but the moment it comes to the U.S. stirring up Ukraine, supporting Israel and the Philippines, you suddenly claim that “a chaotic world benefits America”?

It’s too late to talk about the Pacific. Our official line now is that the Earth can accommodate both China and the U.S., but what they’re probably thinking in reality is: the solar system is huge enough to fit both, because the old bell family just can’t handle that much. 😆
