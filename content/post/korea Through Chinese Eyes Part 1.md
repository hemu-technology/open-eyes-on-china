说实话我挺佩服韩国的，

当年比朝鲜都穷，

吃着破烂泡菜，折箩泔水，部队火锅，

几十年硬是干成了发达国家，

强制服兵役，几乎全民皆兵，

就算去了美国也不受欺负。
</small>
</details>
<div class="translated-text">

To be honest, I kind of admire South Korea.

Back then it was even poorer than North Korea,
living on shabby kimchi, leftover soup, and army stew.

Yet in just a few decades they pushed their way into becoming a developed country.

With mandatory military service, basically everyone’s a soldier.

Even when they go to the U.S., they don’t get pushed around.

To put it bluntly, the reason we Chinese like to mock the Koreans is simply because they’ve made it now.
It’s like this: you’ve had a little brother tagging along with you for twenty years, struggling together but never getting enough to eat.
Then one day he switches sides and follows someone else, and in just three years he’s bought a car, a house, and saved up hundreds of thousands.

It’s exactly because they’re small that development came easier.
When your size is small, kneeling down (meaning submitting/complying) quickly means even a single bite of leftovers can fill you up.
Take India for example — they kneel just as fast, but their size and appetite are so huge that even the “Brits” couldn’t feed them enough.

韩国的地缘放到全球都是极差的类型了，长期在大陆强国和海洋强国的夹缝中求生（以前是中日，现在是中美），几乎算不上真正意义上的主权国家（以部署萨德为例，从韩国的立场看，让外国在本国部署反导已经是耻辱了，还得忍受另一个国家各种横加指责，相应的，如果中国部署反导，韩国能那么强烈的指责吗）。



邻国都是惹不起的国家，中、日、俄罗斯、朝鲜，协商的时候，对方都是是妥妥的站在实力的角度。



经济基础而言，战前韩国饱受侵略和殖民之苦，战后政治不稳定，经济陷入泥沼，而且还因为和朝鲜的战争引得中美下场博弈，境况极差。



韩国能成功跨入发达国家行列，外交上能维持国家的整体安全，文化上在全球都有着不俗的影响力，这种成功，对小国家来说，已经相当厉害了。



个人反感棒子的傲慢自大，但对于全民兵役这个，还是很认可的，这种尚武的基因是要培育的。

Geopolitically, South Korea is in one of the toughest spots in the world — squeezed between continental powers and maritime powers (in the past it was China and Japan, now it’s China and the U.S.).
It can hardly be called a truly sovereign nation. Take the THAAD deployment as an example: from Korea’s standpoint, allowing a foreign country to set up anti-missile systems on its soil is already humiliating, and yet they had to endure constant criticism from another country as well. On the flip side, if China deployed anti-missile systems, would Korea be able to criticize that strongly?

Their neighbors are all countries they cannot afford to provoke — China, Japan, Russia, North Korea. In negotiations, the other side always comes from a position of absolute strength.

Economically, Korea suffered heavily from invasion and colonization before the war. After the war, politics were unstable, the economy was in shambles, and the conflict with North Korea dragged China and the U.S. into a direct confrontation — the situation couldn’t have been worse.

And yet, South Korea still managed to break into the ranks of developed nations. Diplomatically, it’s maintained overall national security. Culturally, it has considerable global influence. For a small country, that level of success is already pretty remarkable.

Personally, I dislike the arrogance of Koreans, but when it comes to mandatory military service, I actually respect it. That kind of martial spirit is something that should be cultivated.

战后中国的政权很稳定，韩国政治上各种动荡；中国的统一进程中，大陆是占据主动权的，是否投入财力物力进行统一都可以主动选择，韩国则要长期防备朝鲜的动向，人财物一日不可废，起点比中国差多了。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
After the war, China’s government was quite stable, whereas South Korea faced constant political turmoil. During China’s unification process, the mainland held the initiative and could choose whether or not to invest resources. South Korea, on the other hand, had to constantly monitor North Korea, with manpower and resources always on alert. In this sense, their starting point was far worse than China’s.

Can’t we take a look at history? South Korea’s first “bucket of gold” was squeezed from the Vietnamese. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. provided \$4 billion in military funding to South Korea — that’s \$4 billion in the 1960s! On top of that, fearing Japan, the U.S. handed over Japanese industries to South Korea. Of course, we also can’t deny South Korea’s own efforts.

中国如果成功变成了发达国家就是韩国（勤奋，能吃苦，工业实力强，崇拜学历）和意大利（美食丰富，历史文化深厚，做事随意灵活）的混合体，跟英国德国日本不是一个套路。

根据我在日本跟韩国同事同学打交道的经验，所有韩国人身上的优缺点都能在中国人（特别是华北地区中国人）身上找到，几百年的小中华思想不是白饶的。

If China successfully becomes a developed country, it would be a mix of South Korea — hardworking, able to endure hardship, strong industrial capability, and valuing education — and Italy — rich cuisine, deep historical culture, and flexible, easygoing approach. It wouldn’t follow the same model as the UK, Germany, or Japan.

Based on my experience interacting with Japanese and Korean colleagues and classmates, all the strengths and weaknesses of Koreans can be found in Chinese people (especially those from North China). Centuries of “Little China” thinking haven’t gone to waste.

China’s economic structure is better than the Soviet Union’s. At least many of its industries survived through brutal competition in the global market. The USSR relied mostly on trade barriers and resource exports. Plus, China has an advantage in scale.

I don’t know about Japan, but Koreans don’t have that strong a sense of personal boundaries. When my mom traveled to Korea, people would quietly help her up and down stairs.

Japanese values are different from ours. The sex industry is well-developed, there are plenty of love hotels, and many AV performers work legally. While most people can’t go every day due to physical limits and money, many Japanese do go frequently. Business trips and overseas travel often present opportunities to visit red-light districts. In areas where Japanese communities live in Vietnam, there are even red-light districts specifically catering to Japanese clients.

He was “deeply disgusted by inhumane treatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. military and extremely disappointed with American society.”

韩国是二战后唯一一个从废墟中崛起的发达国家，不靠卖资源也不靠侵略，从五十年代亚洲最贫穷的国家发展为GDP前十的国度，已经足以说明一切。三星电子与现代起亚集团在不依赖中国市场的情况下依然做到了世界前五，去年韩国最低月薪也达到一万人民币了。最后提一嘴，只要是联合国成员国就是主权国家，要是有美国驻军就意味着耻辱，那网民最崇拜的德国可是有全欧洲最多的美国驻军。

South Korea is the only country after World War II that rose from ruins to become a developed nation without relying on resource exports or conquest. From the 1950s, when it was the poorest country in Asia, it has grown into a top-10 GDP nation — and that says it all. Samsung Electronics and Hyundai-Kia Group made it into the world’s top five even without depending on the Chinese market. Last year, South Korea’s minimum monthly wage even reached around 10,000 RMB.

One final note: as long as a country is a UN member, it’s a sovereign state. Having U.S. troops stationed there doesn’t necessarily mean humiliation. After all, the German netizens admire so much actually host the largest number of U.S. troops in Europe.

你可以看看汉江奇迹的相关文章，韩国的第一桶金来自：色情行业、越南战争、美国支持、日本战后赔款和支持。后来赶上了美国强制要求日本剥离部分产业到了韩国，当然韩国一方面收到美国等国家倾斜性政策，一方面自己也把握住各种机会，算是天时和人和了。我们国家当时蒋校长当时免掉了日本的战后赔款，且解放战争后撤退台湾时基本将大陆黄金等家底儿全部带到台湾了，后来的朝鲜战争、越南战争、珍宝岛战役、中印战争等主要也是咱们自己打的。所以，我们真的是一穷二白起来的，苏联可能前期有些支援吧，也走了一些弯路。直到后来改开经济才慢慢起来。客观的说，我觉得我们发展之路异常艰辛[思考]

You can check out articles on the **Han River Miracle**. South Korea’s first “bucket of gold” came from the sex industry, the Vietnam War, U.S. support, and Japanese postwar reparations and assistance. Later, it benefited when the U.S. forced Japan to divest some of its industries to South Korea. On one hand, South Korea received preferential policies from the U.S. and others, and on the other, it seized various opportunities — a combination of timing and effort.

At that time, our country under Chiang Kai-shek waived Japan’s postwar reparations and, after retreating to Taiwan following the civil war, basically took all of the mainland’s gold and assets to Taiwan. Later conflicts like the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Zhenbao Island incident, and the Sino-Indian War were mostly fought by us ourselves.

So, we really started from scratch. The Soviet Union may have provided some early support, but there were also missteps. It wasn’t until the Reform and Opening-up that our economy began to rise slowly. Objectively speaking, I think our path to development has been extremely arduous 🤔.

Japan thought the same way before signing the Hiroshima Agreement.

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
**The Plaza Accord (1985)**: This was an agreement among five major economies — the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, and the United Kingdom — aimed at depreciating the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and German Deutsche Mark. The goal was to reduce trade imbalances, particularly the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. For Japan, this led to a rapid appreciation of the yen, which significantly affected its export-driven economy and eventually contributed to the asset bubble of the late 1980s.

Reference for context: Netizens sometimes mention the Plaza Accord when discussing Japan’s economic strategies and its reliance on trade policies in the postwar era.

They followed one “big brother” for hundreds of years and almost became just another part of Japan.

Then they switched to a different “big brother,” and in just a few decades, became a developed country.

In this context, “big brother” refers to the major foreign power that a country aligns with for protection and support.

The previous “big brother” was China. For centuries, Korea was under heavy Chinese influence, almost becoming a subordinate state.

The current “big brother” is the United States. In just a few decades after aligning with the U.S., South Korea rapidly developed into a modern, developed country.

This illustrates how strategic alliances with major powers have shaped South Korea’s historical and economic trajectory.

韩国发展和日本有相似性，或者说比日本更日本。

朝鲜战争结束后，韩国只是一个落后破败的农业国；然后和大多数国家一样，先修基建，形成良好的产业园条件。结合本国的农业，形成了以纺织业、食品加工行业等简单轻工业的外贸出口性经济体；70年代开始，韩国逐渐向中高端产业渗透，方法也简单，动用国家力量严格限制外国资本流入，在每个行业选1到2家企业进行巨头式培养，变成了今天的韩国财阀。这种企业巨头，比如轮船、电子产业等等，为韩国创造了大量的财富。

（韩国农业思路比较简单，本身粮食除了水刀基本依赖进口，60年代形成了韩国农业合作社，和中国不同，这种合作社更像是农业公司，进行农业市场化；70—00年代，农村人口大量进入城市，为韩国工业提供了廉价劳动力）。

总的来说就是外贸依赖型、资源匮乏型国家的发展思路
</small>
</details>
<div class="translated-text">
South Korea’s development bears similarities to Japan — or one could say, it’s “more Japanese than Japan.”

After the Korean War, South Korea was just a backward, devastated agricultural country. Like most countries, it first invested in infrastructure, creating favorable conditions for industrial parks. Leveraging its agricultural base, it developed a simple light-industrial export economy focused on textiles, food processing, and similar sectors.

Starting in the 1970s, South Korea gradually moved into mid- to high-end industries. The method was straightforward: the government strictly limited foreign capital inflow and selected one or two companies in each industry for “chaebol-style” development, which became today’s powerful Korean conglomerates. These corporate giants — in shipping, electronics, and other sectors — generated enormous wealth for the country.

(Korean agriculture was relatively simple. Apart from rice, most grains were imported. In the 1960s, South Korea established agricultural cooperatives, which were more like agribusinesses conducting market-oriented agriculture. From the 1970s to 2000s, a massive rural-to-urban migration provided cheap labor for Korean industry.)

Overall, this reflects the development strategy of a trade-dependent, resource-scarce country.

一个极端仇中和反华的国家，仇华程度超越日本。日本只是厌恶中国，韩国则是巴不得中国人都下地狱。

将来万一哪天不得不对外战争的话，第一站很可能是韩国。

蒙古也仇华，但是蒙古仇华是因为怕被中国吸收所以进行仇华教育进行对冲，防止老百姓产生归附中国的念头。

韩国的仇华完全是想取代中国的东亚文明发源地地位，占领中国东北甚至更大地盘，然后鸠占鹊巢窃取中国古文明占为己有，最后以汉字的发明者和中华文化的发明者和传承者自居。当然还有两国产业链高度重叠产生的现实经济利益冲突。

所以，韩国要按照仇敌的定位去对待！虽然它不堪作为中国的对手，但是仇恨它是不会错的。这个国家一有机会会想办法把中国往死里整，以泄他们的心头之恨。他们的历史中写满了中国对他们犯下滔天大罪的事，他们对中国心中只有仇恨。

An extremely Sinophobic and anti-China country, with hostility surpassing even Japan. Japan merely dislikes China, but South Korea seems to wish all Chinese would go to hell.

If there were ever a war, South Korea would likely be the first stop.

Mongolia is also anti-China, but their Sinophobia is driven by fear of being absorbed by China. They conduct anti-China education to prevent their citizens from developing allegiance to China.

South Korea’s anti-China sentiment, however, stems from a desire to replace China as the cradle of East Asian civilization, occupy Northeast China or even larger territories, claim Chinese ancient culture as their own, and present themselves as the inventors and inheritors of Chinese characters and culture. Of course, there’s also the realistic economic conflict caused by highly overlapping industrial chains between the two countries.

Therefore, South Korea should be treated according to its position as a hostile country. While it’s not capable of truly challenging China, hating it is justified. Whenever an opportunity arises, it will try to hurt China as a way to vent its long-standing resentment. Their history is filled with grievances against China, and in their hearts toward China, there is only hatred.

South Korea’s extreme Sinophobia is something anyone with a basic understanding of geopolitics can see.

However, South Korea’s history of development isn’t without dishonorable aspects — under Park Chung-hee, laborers were sent abroad to West Germany and other developed countries, and the foreign currency they earned was used to support Korea’s industrialization. Additionally, to push South Korea onto the path of becoming a developed nation, Park even diverted compensation that Japan had paid to victims of the comfort women system, not to mention the unfortunate women who had to sell their own bodies for money.

Of course, the road to glory is paved with thorns. These methods of earning money were certainly dishonorable, but without them, South Korea today would almost certainly be worse off than North Korea.

South Korea’s greatest contribution since its founding is that it **proved the feasibility of the “authoritarian development” model** in late-developing, non-small countries. South Korea is not like Singapore — a city-state. From its founding, its population was already 16 million, and by the time of its economic takeoff, it approached 40 million, so it certainly wasn’t a tiny country.

South Korea was the first successfully developing former colony/semi-colony, and Park Chung-hee provided late-developing countries with a development methodology that was later validated again in Taiwan and mainland China.
