你可以看看top985大三学生都在干什么：把所有的课全部修完，疯狂刷project，就为了准备保研和夏令营。一切都向只升学看齐，只为9月30日的一路生花。

有offer=有出路=上岸=一路生花。如果不能在大四的夏天之前把出路搞定，那么一切都会变得很难看，而有出路的人则会度过一个最美丽的暑假。

不论是好的idea，创新性想法，还是强大的动手能力，都被第一时间转换成升学的筹码，获取上岸的机会。

夏天对于中国的孩子是特殊的，中考，高考，毕业，考研，进入社会之前所有重大人生转折都发生在夏天。无处可藏的炎热意味着过往的终结和新生活的开启，逼迫着对成熟毫无心理准备的我们往前走。

“一切，等上岸之后再说吧。”
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
Take a look at what top-tier 985 university juniors are doing: rushing to finish all their courses, frantically working on projects, all just to prepare for graduate school recommendations and summer camps. Everything revolves around further education, all for that moment on September 30th when their efforts will finally “blossom.”

In this context, having an offer = having a future = securing a place = blossoming. If you don’t secure your path by the summer of senior year, everything afterwards will look bleak; but for those who already have a way forward, that summer becomes the most beautiful and carefree one.

Whether it’s a good idea, an innovative thought, or strong hands-on ability, everything gets immediately converted into chips for further education—tools for securing a chance to “make it.”

Summer is always special for Chinese students. The high school entrance exam, the college entrance exam, graduation, postgraduate exams, entering society—almost every major life transition happens in summer. The inescapable heat means the end of the past and the start of something new, forcing us, unprepared for maturity, to move forward.

And so, people get used to saying:
“Let’s wait until after we’ve secured a place—then we’ll talk about everything else.”

To be honest, I used to get upset when people said things like this, thinking they were just pro-West or blindly admiring America. But after experiencing society firsthand, I’ve come to see that what they said is real. Young people are pushed forward by the pressures of life, with no room to pause or turn back. Life feels like walking a tightrope — one wrong step, and you plunge into the abyss.

对于新事物的理解总需要使用文字表达出来吧，汉字很难创造新字，现有的汉字意义也是相对固定的，汉字的传承性太好了，传承性好的文字也就意味着创新性差。创新，也就是对于新事物的发展基本上都是基础科学里的抽象内容，请问，用已有传承性很强的汉字怎么表达出来基础科学的创新部分的抽象的内容？

如果能表达出来的话，大部分基础科学发论文为啥都要发到英文期刊，为啥不用汉字发基础科学的研究内容，哪怕汉字现在没有优势，也可以把基础科学的研究内容翻译过来吧，要是能翻译得了，搞基础科研的人也不至于主要参考英文资料。容错率再高，你对新事物的创新也要能表达出来，哪怕你想用英文搞科研，跟人家本身使用英文的欧美人，也没啥优势。

<div class="translated-text">
To understand new things, we inevitably need to express them in words. Chinese characters are difficult to innovate: the meanings of existing characters are relatively fixed, and their heritage is extremely strong. But a writing system with strong continuity usually implies low innovativeness.

Innovation—especially in the development of new concepts—mostly occurs in the abstract domain of basic science. So, how can one use Chinese characters, which are highly traditional, to express the abstract content of basic scientific innovation?

If it were possible, why do most basic science papers need to be published in English journals? Why not use Chinese characters to present the research, even if Chinese currently has no clear advantage? In theory, the research could be translated—but if translation were truly sufficient, scientists would not have to rely so heavily on English-language references.

No matter how tolerant the society is, to innovate on new things, you must be able to express them. Even if you want to do research in English, you still have no inherent advantage over native English-speaking scientists.

Nowadays, getting promoted or earning a “talent title” depends on publishing papers and securing National Natural Science Foundation projects. So you have to choose research directions that are quick, straightforward, and likely to yield high-impact papers. There’s no room for mistakes, or your progress will be delayed.

I’m a typical example of taking the wrong path: I was misled by my advisor into starting a new direction and building up the lab, which delayed a lot of my publications. I’ve already missed my golden period. My junior, five years younger than me, just picks whatever is easy to work on and easy to publish, and now she has already secured a prestigious youth talent grant.

Don’t fall for your advisor’s big promises, and don’t do too much grunt work for them.

The common people are like a flock of sheep, guided entirely by the authorities. The official line is always “stability above all,” and unconventional ideas or independent thinkers create extra management costs. So the public follows that logic. At least, that was the case for people born in the 1950s–70s.

Poverty drives change, and things have improved a lot since the Reform and Opening. Some of the 1980s–90s generation are gradually more accepting, and the 2000s–2010s generation are already experiencing it firsthand.

This is the broader trend of historical development. To avoid falling behind the world, we need to pay more attention to personal development—only then can society as a whole progress. It will take several more generations to fully adapt.

If you have, you should know that once you start 996, you lose all sources of creativity.

Endless repetitive processes, one person doing the work of three, following established routines to test and push forward—minimizing costs to outcompete the Western pioneers ahead.

This is the path dependency of almost every Chinese company.

If you want breakthrough technology, you must first give workers sufficient rest and leisure. Without downtime or space to daydream, how can your brain generate innovative ideas?
(**996** is a work schedule commonly found in some Chinese companies, especially in the tech and startup sectors. It refers to working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.

While it is intended to boost productivity and accelerate company growth, it often leads to extreme fatigue, burnout, and leaves little time for personal life, rest, or creative thinking. Critics argue that 996 stifles innovation and harms workers’ health.)

What culture? It’s just human nature. As Marx said long ago, every pore of capitalism seeps with blood and filth. Today’s Western welfare systems were largely created during the US-Soviet rivalry, as each side tried to prove the superiority of its own system.

所以，不是有人就说了么，美国的强大，根本的原因不是他们的技术，而是他们强大的中产阶级，因为中产，有钱且有闲，所以才能有时间去创意。相反某些地方，他们有所谓的中产么？（真以为大城市里的一套钢筋混凝土就是中产了？它能变现么？）

So, as some people have said, the real reason for America’s strength isn’t their technology—it’s their strong middle class.

(Do you really think a slab of concrete in a big city counts as middle class? Can it generate real value?)

从人类的技术发展历史而言，0→1并不是工程师，而是天才，

而教育目前至少分了两类，一类是普及教育并发现天才，

另外一类是普及并大量复制理工科工程师。

前者在技术上往往承担着突破，后者是规模复制。



大量的史料表明教育能大量培养工程师和岗位人员，

天才，艺术家却并不能被大量培养只能被发现。
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
From the history of human technological development, the leap from 0 → 1 is made not by engineers, but by geniuses.

Currently, education can be roughly divided into two types:

Universal education aimed at discovering geniuses.

Universal education aimed at mass-producing science and engineering professionals.

The former is often responsible for breakthroughs in technology, while the latter focuses on large-scale replication.

Historical evidence shows that education can produce a large number of engineers and workers, but geniuses and artists cannot be mass-produced—they can only be discovered.

0 → 1 is the domain of scientists, while 1 → 100 is the domain of engineers.

坐标瑞典，别的公司不清楚，自己所在的公司总是了解的。

40人的乡镇企业，装备制造业，人均学历应该是职高？反正几个主力设计师只有2个正经本科毕业的。

合作的客户基本全是世界500强，在风电装备细分领域有突出成就，可以在工厂内将800吨的东西搬来搬去，目前世界最先进的16MW海上风电制造商已经买了3台，搁在印度应该是大国重器水平。

拥有目前的技术成就很简单，30年如一日死磕，无数商人邀请老板美国开分公司，中国建工厂（没错，就是本人），巴西，印度建厂。老板一律say no。老板从20吨搬运起家，30年干到800吨，干到全世界几乎没有什么竞争对手，没什么诀窍，就是一点一点慢慢做，20吨做完做50吨，然后100吨，然后300吨，500吨，800吨，目前正在研发1200吨。

瑞典个人财务几乎是透明的，老板把工厂干到这个程度，每年年收入到手大概也就1百万瑞典克朗，折合人民币不到70万，你说值得吗？

我用中国人的思维去想，认为不值得，但是他本人认为很值得，在自己的故乡，开这么一个小工厂，养活40号人，并且技术方面全球领先，收入还远远高于瑞典平均收入，他非常非常的满意，并且愿意长久的经营下去，对于扩产，全球化，财富自由，走上人生巅峰没有丝毫兴趣。

我有一次开玩笑和他说，今年业绩这么好，年底提台法拉利吧，我们也蹭蹭车玩一下，他说，我要是买了台法拉利，所有邻居都会嘲笑我，我都没法出门了，不可能的。

然后年底他花了几十万赞助了本地3线冰球队，冰球队比赛时候都会送我们免费的门票，还有自助餐吃，体验非常好，就是老是输。。。



12-24圣诞前夕更新：

没想到随手写了一个回答这么多人看，针对评论里讨论的比较多的问题回答如下：

问题问的是“为什么突破性的技术总是发生在西方”，我针对这个问题写了这篇小作文，没想到评论里一大堆拿市场，资金利润，投入产出等来杠的。我觉得我写的已经很清楚了啊，问的是技术，我回答的也是技术。欧洲这个环境，天然给这些研究技术的小厂以保障和生存空间，他们不需要想别的，几十年如一日研发技术就好了。我公司的老板和研发人员，一年休4周的年休假，加上圣诞放假什么的，一年满打满算工作220多天，每天8小时。看起来是不是很轻松，但是他们能保证这个工作时间里80%都在埋着头研发技术，不用去考虑生存、市场环境、知识产权、政商关系等等和技术无关的问题。欧洲成千上万的小厂都是这样干的，因为他们知道这是最佳的生存方式。等他们的技能树哪一天点的差不多了，再由一些大厂把这些技能点整合起来，就成了突破性技术了，请参考ASML光刻机的核心供应商群体。
如果我们想要突破性技术发生在国内，我们就要想办法营造一样的营商环境，这样小厂老板不用天天担心朝不保夕，大厂也不会整天想着小厂的三瓜两枣整到自己碗里，你是大厂你有钱，别人有好东西你买就好了么，没必要把别人逼到绝路上。
如果你不是想讨论技术，而是想整点别的宏大叙事，直接叉掉就好了，没必要评论区非要杠两下。评论区大量评论都被删了，我是没干过啊，也不知道你们都说了啥。
年薪70万在瑞典真的是妥妥的高薪了，瑞典平均月工资只有人民币3万多，码农可能好一点，能到5，6万，清洁工，餐馆端盘子的只有1万5左右，和中国没法比。PS:别想着来瑞典端盘子了，瑞典不是移民国家，现在政客们越来越保守，今年出了个政策，不到2万8瑞典克朗，也就是2万人民币左右，不给你续签和拿永居，这里消费还高，真的没啥意思。

I live in Sweden, and while I can’t speak for every company, I know my own very well. It’s a 40-person township enterprise in equipment manufacturing. Most employees have vocational high school education; among the core designers, only two have a formal bachelor’s degree.

Despite this, their clients are almost all Fortune 500 companies. In the niche of wind power equipment, the company has achieved remarkable feats: they can move components weighing up to 800 tons inside the factory, and the world’s most advanced 16MW offshore wind power manufacturer has already bought three of their machines. In India, these machines would be considered national-level heavy equipment.

How did they reach this technological level? There’s no secret: 30 years of relentless dedication. Businesspeople from the US, China, Brazil, and India have invited the owner to open branches abroad, but he has said no every time. Starting from 20-ton equipment, he has gradually scaled up to 800 tons, step by step: 20 → 50 → 100 → 300 → 500 → 800. Currently, he is developing 1,200-ton machines.

Personal finances in Sweden are largely transparent. With the factory at this level, the owner’s annual take-home income is roughly 1 million SEK (less than 70,000 USD). From a Chinese perspective, that might seem modest. But he is extremely satisfied: running a small factory in his hometown, providing jobs for 40 people, leading the world in technology, and earning far above Sweden’s average wage. He has no interest in global expansion, chasing wealth, or personal fame.

I once jokingly suggested, “Performance is so good this year—why not buy a Ferrari?” He replied: “If I bought a Ferrari, all the neighbors would mock me. I wouldn’t even be able to leave the house. Impossible.” Instead, at the end of the year, he spent tens of thousands of SEK sponsoring a local third-tier ice hockey team. We got free tickets and buffet meals at games—a great experience, even if the team always lost.

This argument might work in the cultural or artistic fields, but in industrial sectors, it’s complete nonsense. You can’t just sit and imagine a design and expect it to magically work. Without industrial efficiency and supply chains (and, to some extent, lower labor costs), who’s going to repeatedly test and iterate from design drawings to large-scale products? Are the trial-and-error costs low? How skilled are the workers? Where’s the market? If you can’t reduce industrial costs, the selling price will be high—so where’s the competitiveness? Industry is brutal; it doesn’t care about welfare or ideals.

小国才能这么多福利，因为国家整体有优势分工，内部的这个厂能运行下去，是因为地方保护主义，默认就选这个公司的产品了。还是因为这个赛道竞争小，那些竞争大的行业，肯定有大国抢的。
大国内部竞争肯定更强烈，因为市场大，如果使用金融手段，先做大，你如果不做大，别人做大就会取代你。
所以中国更多而商业模式创新，模式一旦突破，可以短时间遍布全国，你不扩张，别人可以用量积累客户和技术，打败你是迟早的事
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
Only small countries can afford such extensive welfare because the state benefits from overall advantageous division of labor. A local factory can survive thanks to local protectionism—it’s almost guaranteed that this company’s products will be chosen—or because the market segment is small, with little competition. In industries with fierce competition, larger countries inevitably dominate.

In a large country like China, internal competition is much stronger because the market is huge. If you leverage financial means to scale first, you gain a head start; if you don’t, someone else will expand and replace you. That’s why in China there’s more emphasis on business model innovation—once a model breaks through, it can quickly spread nationwide. If you don’t expand, competitors can accumulate customers and technology through scale, and it’s only a matter of time before they overtake you.

看文中的描述，就是个工厂内的大型搬运设备，我不知道这是个什么设备，也不知道40人的工厂掌握的这种设备的核心技术是个啥（我觉得首先一个设备上的核心机电控制系统就不可能是自制的），但是我觉得这东西对中国企业没啥技术门槛，现在还活着纯粹是因为中国企业没注意，或者还没看上这个市场罢了（有可能是市场太小，也可考虑到还要研发，利润的角度不划算）
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
From the description in the text, it seems to be a large material-handling machine inside a factory. I don’t know exactly what type of equipment it is, nor the core technology a 40-person factory possesses for it (I think the core electromechanical control system on such a device is unlikely to be entirely homemade). However, I feel that this equipment probably doesn’t pose much of a technical barrier for Chinese companies. Its survival so far is likely because Chinese firms either haven’t noticed it or haven’t considered entering this market yet—perhaps the market is too small, or from an R\&D and profit perspective, it isn’t worth the investment.

我在国内珠三角从事自动化行业，干机械设计，前后十年了。潜心研究，当然不是说什么高科技，只是想把事情做到极致（质量、功能、成本）。这点在国内很缺乏，不是某一家公司如此，而是普遍现象。缺乏对技术的敬畏之心，满脑子都是快钱，工期无底线压缩，可想而知得到的质量和功能能如何。而且这种现象短期改变不了。

I’ve been working in the automation industry in the Pearl River Delta for about ten years, focusing on mechanical design. I dedicate myself to research—not pursuing high-tech breakthroughs, just striving to perfect things in terms of quality, functionality, and cost. This kind of dedication is rare in China; it’s not limited to one company—it’s a widespread phenomenon. There’s a lack of respect for technology, and the mindset is dominated by chasing quick profits, with deadlines compressed without limits. You can imagine what that does to quality and functionality. Moreover, this situation isn’t something that can be changed in the short term.

The kind of phenomena the original poster mentioned also exist in Germany and Japan.

我对瑞典公司记忆最深刻的一次， 前些年有过一次严重的烫伤，医院用了一种瑞典公司专利的 Mepilex含银的海绵垫，带胶的一面直接贴伤口上，旁边再固定一下就完事了。 渗出的组织液把胶溶解，再被海绵吸收，伤口一直是干爽的，还有银离子防感染。 换药的时候一点点的粘连都没有，完全无感。 真的是好东西。

<div class="translated-text">
One of my most vivid experiences with a Swedish company was a few years ago when I suffered a serious burn. The hospital used a patented Mepilex silver-containing foam dressing from a Swedish company. The adhesive side was applied directly to the wound, and then it was lightly fixed in place. The exuding tissue fluid would dissolve the adhesive and get absorbed by the foam, keeping the wound dry, while the silver ions prevented infection. When changing the dressing, there was no sticking at all—completely painless. It really is an excellent product.

Swedish factories like this can only dominate niche markets—specialized fields where the “tech skill points” are in remote corners of the innovation tree. The market is small, the ROI is low, and even if big investors come in, there’s no profit. That’s why they can thrive independently. In a large industry, the same approach would fail immediately.

This is just a Western narrative. High-end industries require capital and manpower that elite small firms alone cannot support. If Western elite small firms were really that strong, why would they be afraid of China developing a lithography machine? It’s not that elite small firms aren’t capable—they’re worth learning from, and in fact we have quite a few of our own. But everything needs to align with its environment and underlying rules to thrive. The operational logic of elite small firms is fundamentally different from that of mainstream industry; each has its own path. In a country as large as ours, if we don’t scale up our own mass production, why envy and imitate someone else’s small firm? It makes no sense.
