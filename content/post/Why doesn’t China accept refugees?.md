他回答的两点，非常好，一，同不同意移民，是中国人自己的问题，他没法代表中国人回答，也就意思是，别的国家更不能强加给中国。二，别的国家不要把价值观强加给别人。他很有立场。一点没被带偏
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
His response highlighted two very good points:

1. Whether to accept immigrants is a matter for the Chinese people themselves. He cannot speak for all Chinese, which also implies that no other country has the right to impose this on China.
2. Other countries should not impose their values on others.

He has a clear stance and wasn’t swayed at all.👍

To put it bluntly: in the late Tang Dynasty, the influx of people from various countries and ethnicities weakened internal cohesion, almost leading to the extinction of the Han Chinese during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Later, in the Song Dynasty, some Jews allegedly betrayed the dynasty, facilitating the Yuan invasion.

It should be said like this: 500 years ago, China accepted Jewish refugees. Later, when Zhu Yuanzhang founded the Ming Dynasty, he had them all executed. Do you know why? Because they betrayed the country that had originally accepted them.

The “beautiful country” has a land area much larger than China but a population less than a third of China’s. It could easily host all the refugees in the world. Yet, if you look closely, most of the world’s refugees are connected to this “beautiful country”! The root causes of most refugees can be traced back to it. （“Beautiful Country” is a sarcastic nickname Chinese netizens use to refer to the United States.）

还得说，今天的难民是谁造成的？西方造成了难民潮，要中国替他们承担后果，中国人不可能接受！其实还有一个事实，即使中国愿意接受，可没有一个难民会主动选择去中国。他们都希望去往富裕的欧洲。这可不是中国鼓动的。所以，西方人自己造的孽自己受！
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It must also be said: who is responsible for today’s refugees? The West has created this refugee crisis and wants China to bear the consequences—but Chinese people will never accept that! In fact, even if China were willing to accept refugees, not a single one would voluntarily choose to go there. They all want to go to wealthy Europe. This was not instigated by China. So the West must face the consequences of the mess it has created!

The U.S. and the Western powers create wars but refuse to end them, yet they expect an unrelated third party—China—to bear the responsibility for the resulting refugees, under the pretext of “great power responsibility.” So, not answering directly is the right approach: those who cause the mess must deal with it themselves. That is the correct principle.

Because of the guilt they carry from World War II, Germans have long felt a sense of inferiority. As a result, whenever an opportunity arises, they try to seize the moral high ground. They strive to act as global moral arbiters. After the Second Gulf War, Germany managed to claim the moral high ground over the Americans, which alarmed the U.S. In response, the Americans tightened their control, infiltrating German politics, conducting surveillance, cultivating political agents, and consolidating influence over European media. These actions have contributed to the bizarre phenomena and low-IQ political performances we now see across European politics.

The U.S. and Western countries have long portrayed China as backward and low-quality, and these refugees often share similar stereotypes.

谁造成的难民危机谁就去解决，为什么一定要把难题推在不相干的国家身上来。中国是一个有一十四亿多人口的大国，不象几百万一两千万的国家。如果是难民潮湧上中国，对中国的国家稳定和安全，人民的正常生活秩序都会造成很大的冲击和不确定性，如果造成上述情况国家要想走向正规也不是短时间能解决的。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Whoever causes a refugee crisis should be the one to resolve it. Why should the burden be pushed onto unrelated countries? China is a large country with over 1.4 billion people, unlike countries with only a few million or tens of millions. If a massive influx of refugees were to flood into China, it would seriously impact national stability, security, and the normal daily life of its people. Resolving such consequences and returning the country to normalcy would not be achievable in a short period.

The most important point is: whoever starts the war, creates chaos, and produces refugees should be the one to take responsibility—in short, you reap what you sow. Secondly, China is a populous developing country with its own internal challenges; it’s better to take care of our own people first rather than create problems for the world.

The so-called “shared values” promoted by the West is essentially ideological colonialism! They dress it up as something noble and lofty.

You’ve never done it, so why are you morally coercing us to take responsibility? Why don’t you, the West, take them yourselves?

西方国家，我发现都特别没礼貌，总是打断别人说话。我看到的是，她们急了

I’ve noticed that Western countries can be quite impolite, often interrupting others while they speak. What I observed was that they got flustered.

中国对难民问题持谨慎态度，并非完全不接受，而是综合考虑多方面因素。历史上，中国曾因接收难民遭受过惨痛教训，如“五胡乱华”以及二战期间犹太难民在东北的情况等。此外，中国人口众多，人均资源有限，就业、医疗和教育资源紧张，难以承受大规模接收难民带来的社会压力。同时，难民潮可能成为极端分子混入的渠道，威胁国家安全稳定

China takes a cautious approach to the refugee issue; it is not that the country completely refuses refugees, but rather that it considers multiple factors. Historically, China has suffered serious consequences from accepting refugees, such as during the “Wu Hu disturbances” and the case of Jewish refugees in Northeast China during World War II. Additionally, with a large population and limited per capita resources, employment, healthcare, and education systems are already under pressure, making it difficult to bear the social strain of receiving large numbers of refugees. At the same time, a surge of refugees could potentially become a channel for extremists to infiltrate, posing a threat to national security and stability.

中国人多地少。真正需要援助的国家中国无条件授助你而且都是第一个援助的物资到达，维和部队人数也是中国人民解放军最多。

China has a large population but limited land. For countries genuinely in need of assistance, China provides unconditional aid and is often the first to deliver supplies. Moreover, in peacekeeping missions, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army contributes the largest number of personnel.
