<span style="font-size: 2em;">🗣</span>中国有一点美国比不了。  
那就是中国买什么都是可控的，美国却不是。  
中国甚至不需要关税就可以不买美国的东西，但美国做不到。  
就像大豆一样，中国说不买就不买了，降关税也没用。  
但美国会说不买，就不买中国的商品吗？  
在我看来，这才是特朗普没意识到关税战美国的劣势。  
只要中国突破什么，就可以少买一些美国货，但美国突破一些，不一定会少买一些中国货。  
特朗普如果意识不到这点，不想办法应对，那我认为关税战吃亏的是美国。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
here’s one advantage China has that the US simply can’t match: China can control what it buys, while the US cannot.

China doesn’t even need tariffs to stop buying American products—but the US doesn’t have the same leverage.

Take soybeans as an example. China can simply decide not to buy them, and lowering tariffs won’t make a difference.

But if the US says it won’t buy Chinese goods, will it actually reduce its purchases? Not necessarily.

In my view, this is a key disadvantage in the tariff war that Trump seemed to overlook.

China can always adjust its imports to reduce purchases of American goods. The US, on the other hand, may not be able to achieve the same effect with Chinese goods.

If Trump fails to recognize this and doesn’t come up with a strategy to address it, the US is the one that will ultimately suffer in the tariff war.

美国最大的问题是只聚焦在高端产品。那么必然可以通过非法途径获得。而中国产品中高低端都有，中低端一旦限制了，那么量的缺失美国很难补上，势必造成通胀和社会动荡。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The biggest problem for the US is that it focuses only on high-end products. These can always be obtained through illegal or alternative channels.

China, on the other hand, produces both high-end and low- to mid-end goods. Once the supply of mid- and low-end products is restricted, the US would struggle to make up for the shortfall. This would inevitably lead to inflation and social unrest.

The scariest part is that Trump can’t control the capitalists. American multinational companies are making money all over the world. If they don’t “pay protection” to Trump, what can he do?

On top of that, he’s cutting taxes. Meanwhile, the US is waging wars everywhere, spending trillions on the military each year—essentially working for free for the multinational corporations.

你说的有道理，我也同意。

这不仅仅是调侃，中国有这么大掌控力的前提是，对全体国民负责。
美国只需要对部分人负责就行了，而且只需要让他们觉得负责就可以。

You make a good point, and I agree.
But we shouldn’t underestimate the resilience of the US. Look at how many people died from COVID—yet the public carried on as if nothing had happened.

This isn’t just joking. The reason China can exert such strong control is that it is responsible for all its citizens.
The US only needs to be responsible for a portion of the population, and it only needs to make them feel that it’s responsible.

这就要回到最初的那个话题了，美国为什么要跟中国打贸易战？在制裁前，中国以及国内某些公司一方面进口美欧日韩等国以芯片为代表的高科技产品，又同时不甘心落后积极建立自己的低端科技和产业，并不断积累技术向上攀登，打破欧美的科技垄断，当时网络上还流传着科技无国界的笑话，嘲讽中国及相关企业重复造轮子。现在看像是美国在掐自己的脖子，那只是因为它的对手是中国，并不是这招式不管用了，换成中国外的任何一个国家现在都已经被掐死了
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
This brings us back to the original question: why did the US launch a trade war against China?

Before the sanctions, China and some domestic companies were simultaneously importing high-tech products like chips from the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea, while also striving not to fall behind by actively developing their own low-end technologies and industries. They kept accumulating knowledge and climbing the technological ladder, gradually breaking the Western tech monopoly.

At the time, there was even a joke circulating online about “technology has no borders,” mocking Chinese companies for “reinventing the wheel.”

Looking back now, it seems as if the US is choking itself—but that’s only because its opponent is China. This tactic hasn’t lost its effectiveness; if the target were any other country outside China, it would likely have already been crippled.

这就是他说的非关税壁垒啊，因此他认为美国对中国（或EU）的关税应该比反过来才公平。然而这个逻辑十分奇怪，一般人完全不理解，把美国的名声搞得奇臭无比。这就是现在的国际秩序，好处都让太平洋西岸拿了，臭名全让东岸背了，因此西岸完全不想收复台湾打破这个秩序（手动惊喜）
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
This is exactly what he calls a “non-tariff barrier.” That’s why he believes US tariffs on China (or the EU) should be higher than the other way around to be “fair.”

However, this logic is very strange and hard for most people to understand, making the US’s reputation look extremely bad.

This is the current international order: the benefits all go to the West Coast of the Pacific, while the East Coast bears all the bad reputation. That’s also why the West Coast has no real incentive to “take back Taiwan” and disrupt this order (surprise, hand gesture).

<span style="font-size: 2em;">🗣</span>关税帝君没想明白一个事，或者说很多外国领导人都没想明白一个事，中国政府说出的话一定是集体意志。

说出来了就要办，中国外交不搭理你，是没必要。但是搭理你了，证明有些事我要做了。外国则是管特喵的，我先喵喵喵几句，大不了我推特道歉，反正把天桶塌了民众都不一定能管我。

其实有时候国人也没意识到这件事，或者说意识到了，但还不确切理解。

而不是西方政治那套，政客是政客，执行者是执行者，它不是绝对的等号。其实不管是美国还是哪个国家，举一个大家比较能理解的，英剧《YP》《YM》，它的本意是解释文官群体（政府执行人员）与政客（资本选举代理人）的制衡和合作。

其实就这一个框架可以解释大多数西方政府，政客在前台口嗨是不需要为执行负绝对责任的。政客可以在前台肆意表演，它所需要负责的只是这四年纸面上的政绩让好看就完了。还记得咱老中特别讨厌的就是哪个领导为了自己上任几年的政绩在地方一通胡搞么，短视是老中非常讨厌的行为，要是哪个领导被爆出来这么干了，赛博亡国论都要来了。

这也是为什么我们听到哪个政客反中言论的时候，甚至觉得这个国家都讨厌，因为我们自始自终的想法都是你与你的执行一体，换句话说言行一致。

所以有些政客第一时间听到中国发出什么什么政策的时候不以为然，觉得可能和自己政府一样。我口嗨而已，你看马克龙就是，一会切换戴高乐模式，一会走地鸡模式。你能接受中国外交形象出现这种模式么？中国有个词语叫朝令夕改，这个词是真的骂亡国气象的。中国还有些词，前倨后恭，令人发笑，两面三刀小人也。

这半年不是一堆人分析特朗普采用了破窗效应的打法么，先提出一个对方完全不能接受的，再提一个可以接受的，这样还给了对方回国交代的权利，你看你美爸爸还是放过你了哦。

结果他没想到的是中国每一步交往都不是考虑单纯一个外交会发生什么，而是站在中国大方针上来考量的，这就打破了对方的哭闹，你哭闹干我毛事，你的口嗨，不能影响我的步伐。

所以他的离谱行为根本威慑不到人，你哭闹打滚只会让我们乐呵，你要想谈实际的那就坐到桌子上来聊聊。

The “Tariff Emperor” didn’t figure out one thing—or rather, many foreign leaders never figure out it: when the Chinese government speaks, it represents the collective will.

Once something is said, it must be done. If Chinese diplomacy ignores you, that’s because it’s unnecessary. But if it engages with you, it means some action is about to happen.

Foreign politicians? Who cares—they just tweet a few words, and if it backfires, they can always apologize on Twitter. Even if the sky falls, the public may not be able to hold them accountable.

Actually, sometimes even Chinese citizens don’t fully realize this, or they sense it but don’t quite understand it.

Unlike Western politics, where politicians and civil servants are separate entities, and one isn’t absolutely equal to the other. Take, for instance, the British series YP or YM—its original purpose was to explain the balance and cooperation between civil servants (government executors) and politicians (capital-elected agents).

This framework explains most Western governments: politicians can make wild statements in public without bearing absolute responsibility for execution. They just need to make the four-year record look decent on paper. Remember how our leaders particularly hated it when someone pursued short-term local achievements for their own tenure? In the West, such behavior would spark massive criticism, almost like a “cyber collapse” theory.

This is why when we hear anti-China rhetoric from Western politicians, we often feel like the whole country hates us—because we instinctively assume the politician and their executive branch are one and the same: words and actions should align.

So, when a politician hears China announce a policy, they may dismiss it, thinking it’s like their own government: just empty talk. Take Macron, switching between De Gaulle mode and “chicken on the ground” mode. Could you imagine the Chinese diplomatic image doing that? We have words for that: chaoling xige (orders change overnight), which signals national weakness. Or qianju hougong (arrogant then humble), used for laughable, two-faced schemers.

This past six months, everyone analyzed Trump’s “broken window” tactic: first propose something completely unacceptable, then a slightly acceptable version, giving the other side a chance to “report back” to their own people. Look, your “daddy US” let you off the hook.

But what he didn’t expect was that every step of China’s diplomacy isn’t calculated just for one meeting—it’s considered from the perspective of China’s overarching strategy. That breaks the opponent’s tantrums: your whining doesn’t affect my plan.

His absurd behavior could never intimidate anyone. Throwing a tantrum only makes us amused. If you want real negotiation, then sit at the table and talk.

捷克🇨🇿总统去见了大和尚，我们宣布不和他进行任何交往。最搞笑的是他们政府竟然说“总统与大和尚接触是属于私人性质，捷克与中国尚未建立最高层级别的直接沟通，因此中国这一举动不会改变现况”。真是搞不通他们的脑回路，一国总统与别人会面竟然说只是他的“私自行为”[好奇]

The Czech 🇨🇿 president went to meet the Grand Monk, and we announced that we won’t engage in any official contact with him.

The funniest part is that their government actually said: “The president’s contact with the Grand Monk is of a private nature. Since China has not yet established direct top-level communication with the Czech Republic, this action will not change the current situation.”

It’s really hard to understand their logic—how can a head of state meeting someone be called merely a “private action”? 🤔

The Chinese have thousands of years of cultural heritage, which makes them extremely serious when it comes to politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Every word they speak and every decision they make is treated with utmost caution.

Europe and the US used to be like this as well—they could also take politics seriously. But in recent years, it has turned into a spectacle of empty talk by politicians. People like Trump come to power just to brag and spout nonsense.

Understanding this is extremely difficult. Even the pro-China voices in the West mostly say that China develops well because its system is efficient.

The implied meaning is that China is centralized. Especially those old gentlemen from Singapore who have been hopping around praising China recently—everyone knows what they really mean.

When they finally realize that Chinese decisions represent the collective will, their worldview will really collapse. At that point, being sympathetic to China won’t be far off.

Don’t be fooled by people constantly claiming that foreign politics is superior and that everyone participates in elections, while Chinese officials are all about bureaucratic talk.

In reality, they themselves also think in a “Chinese-style” way. If our officials only cared about empty talk, changed policies overnight, and didn’t stand by their words, the public would be the first to jump up and say that politics isn’t serious and treat it like a game.

<span style="font-size: 2em;">🗣</span>当然不会无限，甚至不会很久，大概在两年内就会出现极大变动

因为美国挺不住，不是挺不住关税冲击

而是挺不住不跟中国进行完全贸易

至于我们还会不会恢复这个贸易伙伴的地位？不好说，有不小的可能不会


思考这么一个简单的问题

知道中国现在不太从美国买大豆了，同时中国的进口占全世界大豆贸易的接近70%

那

美国人，现在还要不要种大豆？中国不买你种了基本等于全烂，在一年时间内让美国去产生对这些大豆的使用需求，根本不可能

那如果今夏不种了，特朗普又跟中国谈成了大豆贸易，哪儿来的大豆交货？违约了怎么办？

你用存货去交货，中国要求当年的，怎么办？还是违约啊

还有，你不种大豆了，这些地干啥？种什么？种完了能卖出去么？

而实际的情况，比这个还糟

美国各种农作物是高度工业化生产种植的，大企业去雇佣农户种植是主要形式（也就是地主/佃农），所以，这些大宗商品的农作物，在美国播种有着非常详细的日程表，地域区别很小，而大豆的播种时间，是七月份，已经过了
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Of course, it won’t go on indefinitely, and it probably won’t last very long—major changes will likely happen within two years.

The US can’t hold out—not because of the tariff impact itself, but because it can’t afford to not trade with China at all.

As for whether we will restore the US as a trading partner? Hard to say—there’s a significant chance that we won’t.

Consider a simple question:

China now buys very little soybeans from the US, while China’s imports account for nearly 70% of the global soybean trade.

So, do Americans still want to plant soybeans? If China doesn’t buy, planting them is basically wasted. Within a year, it’s impossible for the US to create domestic demand for all these soybeans.

Now, if they didn’t plant this summer, and Trump somehow negotiated soybean trade with China, where would the soybeans come from? What happens if they default?

If you try to deliver from storage, China demands soybeans from the current year—so again, it’s a default.

Moreover, what do you do with the land if you don’t plant soybeans? What else could you plant? Even if you plant something else, can it be sold?

In reality, the situation is even worse.

US crop production is highly industrialized. Large companies hire farmers to plant (basically a landlord/tenant model). For these bulk crops, the planting schedule is very detailed and regionally consistent. For soybeans, the planting season is in July—which has already passed.

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It’s not like the soybeans would just rot in the fields. Even if they’re damaged, someone would still buy them—for example, in Muslim countries like Indonesia or Egypt. Since they can’t eat pork and beef is too expensive, soy products are an important protein source.

But these countries aren’t wealthy, and after the sale, the farmland would still end up being acquired by big internet landlords like Gates or Bezos.

Hard to say.
It depends on whose economy can withstand the pressure.

Judging from the Fed’s stubborn refusal to cut interest rates, it’s clear that traditional investment sectors aren’t optimistic about the current US economy.

China faces challenges too.
Transforming into a consumption-driven market is painful. Inevitably, some people will be left behind. These people may end up like “human batteries,” with income roughly equal to basic expenses.

A consumption-driven society is inherently a high-capital society—only high costs can generate a significant share of GDP and income. Otherwise, where would the money come from?

In such a high-capital society, people at the lower end of the income scale can never save enough, no matter how hard they work. The US, Japan, and Korea all follow this pattern.

Honestly, I prefer the current structure: low-income people don’t see a huge difference in living standards.

Compared to the US, China still has many cards to play, whereas the US has already used up most of its leverage through national debt. China is just getting started.

This could very well turn into a twenty-year-long competition.
