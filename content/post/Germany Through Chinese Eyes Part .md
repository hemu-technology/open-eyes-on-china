From a Chinese netizen’s perspective, these comments reveal a complex fascination with Germany’s history, culture, and military achievements.

Many distinguish between the valor and strategy of the Wehrmacht and the ideology of the Nazi regime, appreciating post-war Germany’s reflection and reforms, and viewing Germany as a multifaceted nation worthy of study, fascination, and nuanced understanding rather than blind admiration.

>In China, there are numerous popular anecdotes about Germany: the legendary durability of {{< tip text="Common online anecdote in China used to praise perceived German-built infrastructure durability; often cited whether or not the specific origin is verifiable." variant="info" >}}Qingdao’s sewer system{{< /tip >}}, the fact that Shanghai Metro Line 1 was built with German technical support, and the famous “extra-long handshake” between Premier Zhu Rongji and a German Chancellor.

Is it admiration for strength? A sense of cultural resonance between the two nations? Germany’s assistance to the People’s Republic of China during its early years? Or perhaps the long-standing influence of German music, philosophy, and science?

{{< headingorig title="Content" level="3" >}}

德国是伟大的国家，但有的人喜欢的不是伟大的德国，而是那个肮脏的德国。

他们不喜欢费尔巴哈、叔本华、尼采、康德、黑格尔、马克思的，思想澎湃的德国。
他们不喜欢高斯、黎曼、伦琴、开普勒、莱布尼茨的，智慧云集的德国。
他们不喜欢贝多芬、巴赫、瓦格纳、门德尔松、勃拉姆斯、舒曼、海涅、歌德的，音乐与诗歌的德国。
他们不喜欢马丁路德、闵采尔、台尔曼、卢森堡、李卜克内西的，为真理、解放、正义而战的德国。

他们单单喜欢那个希特勒、戈培尔、希姆莱的，血腥、肮脏、反人类的纳粹德国，居然还自以为德国因这一段历史而伟大！

他们崇拜着反万字旗的德国，对战后的德国充满鄙视。殊不知战后的两德国旗——黑红金旗帜正是诞生于农民战争之中，承载着真正的德意志精神的。然而有些人喜爱的宣传的都是美好事物的反面。然而这些反面不过是几百年历史中短短不到十页的篇章罢了，是世界人民都唾弃的历史了，它根本不配代表德国。

喜爱纳粹的人不配夸赞德国。

他们吹嘘道：纳粹的科学技术和严谨的工程举世无双！然而正是希特勒导致了德国科学的衰落。正是他的纲领，把一大批科学家赶到美国，让历史悠久的洪堡、哥廷根全都沦为空壳，甚至不如加拿大和澳洲的学校。

他们吹嘘道：纳粹的军装、仪式、军人精神举世无双！然而这些不过是普鲁士军事文化的延续，和纳粹没有任何关系。这些风貌从德意志帝国到国家人民军，我们都可以见到。但在这些人的嘴里却变成了纳粹独有。

他们被全民皆兵的民族梦幻陶醉，唱着所谓的《闪电部队在前进》（甚至连真正的纳粹军歌都没有听过），却未曾听闻《起来战斗》和《荒原战士》，不知道德国共产党员始终战斗在西班牙，战斗在集中营，战斗在苏军的阵线中。民主德国的领导人和将军们，都是从最黑暗的时代和最血腥的战斗中一路走来的。

德国，德国，是如何被这些东西代表了？如何被这样解构了？是如何被这样扭曲了？

但这不能阻止我们去了解和热爱——德国在数百年历史中历经沧桑，缔造辉煌，岂是你纳粹一家的抹黑和污点就能掩盖的？我们大多数人，还将继续去向德国学习。

我们心中永远铭记的是无数思想飞扬的头脑，是无数美好的诗歌与旋律，是无数自由与解放的热血。我们牢记马克思的启迪，哼唱贝多芬的旋律，哀悼卢森堡的牺牲，不会忘记黑红金的涵义。我们了解历史，学习知识，然后去实践，去战斗，去热爱我们的生活。

德国是伟大而美好的。正如翻过那最肮脏卑劣的一页，就是废墟上崛起的柏林。但谁想给那耻辱柱上的一页赋予伟大的意义，那他最应当尝尝斯塔西的铁拳，那他最应当戴上德国警察的手铐。

我们永远要消灭法西斯。

Germany is a great country — but some people do not love the great Germany; they love a filthy Germany.

They do not love the Germany of Feuerbach, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kant, Hegel, and Marx — the Germany of overflowing ideas.
They do not love the Germany of Gauss, Riemann, Röntgen, Kepler, and Leibniz — the Germany of concentrated intellect.
They do not love the Germany of Beethoven, Bach, Wagner, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Schumann, Heine, and Goethe — the Germany of music and poetry.
They do not love the Germany of Martin Luther, Thomas Müntzer, Thälmann, Rosa Luxemburg, or Liebknecht — the Germany that fought for truth, liberation, and justice.

They only love that {{< tip text="Adolf Hitler (1889–1945): Führer of Nazi Germany (1933–1945); initiated WWII in Europe and directed genocidal policies including the Holocaust (systematic murder of six million Jews and millions of other victims)." variant="info" >}}Hitler{{< /tip >}}–Goebbels–Himmler Germany — the bloody, filthy, inhuman Nazi Germany — and actually delude themselves into thinking Germany is great because of that chapter of history!

They worship the {{< tip text="A hooked cross symbol (卐) used by many ancient cultures as a benign emblem of prosperity or auspiciousness; it was appropriated and permanently stigmatized by the Nazi regime." variant="info" >}}swastika{{< /tip >}}, they look down on post-war Germany. Yet many do not realize that the {{< tip text="The modern German tricolor (black-red-gold) emerged as a liberal/national symbol in the early 19th century—linked to student fraternities (Burschenschaften), the 1848 revolutions, and later adopted by the Weimar Republic and post‑WWII democratic Germany." variant="info" >}}black-red-gold flag{{< /tip >}} of the post-war Germany was born out of the farmers’ and liberal movements; it carries the true German spirit. What some people admire and promote are simply the opposite of those noble things. Those ugly opposites are only a few pages in a history spanning centuries — pages that all peoples of the world reject. They do not, and should not, represent Germany.

Those who adore Nazism are not worthy to praise Germany.

They boast: “Nazi science and engineering were unparalleled!” Yet it was {{< tip text="Adolf Hitler’s ideological purges (notably anti-Jewish laws like the 1933 Civil Service Law) forced leading scientists (e.g., Einstein, Schrödinger, Born) into exile, accelerating decline in German academic dominance." variant="info" >}}Hitler{{< /tip >}} who precipitated the decline of German science. His policies drove a great many scientists to the United States, hollowing out once-vibrant institutions like Humboldt and Göttingen — institutions that, in some ways, became weaker than universities in Canada or Australia.

They brag: “Nazi uniforms, ceremonies, and military spirit were unrivaled!” But these are mostly continuations of Prussian military culture and have nothing uniquely Nazi about them. Those features can be seen from the German Empire through later armed forces; they were not invented by the Nazis. Yet in their mouths these traits become exclusive to Nazism.

They are intoxicated by the fantasy of a nation mobilized for war, singing of the so-called “Blitz units advancing” (and many have not even heard authentic Nazi marching songs), yet they have never listened to songs like “Arise and Fight” or “Warriors of the Wasteland” — nor do they know that German communists fought in Spain, in concentration camps, and on the Soviet fronts. The leaders and generals of Democratic Germany (East Germany) came up through the darkest times and the bloodiest struggles.

How — how did Germany come to be represented by these things? How was it deconstructed like this? How was it so distorted?

But none of this can stop us from learning about and loving Germany. Over centuries Germany has endured great vicissitudes and created glories — a stain by one family (the Nazis) cannot erase that. Most of us will continue to learn from Germany.

What we will forever remember are countless brilliant minds, countless beautiful poems and melodies, countless sacrifices for freedom and liberation. We recall Marx’s insights, hum the tunes of Beethoven, mourn Luxemburg’s sacrifice, and will not forget the meaning of the black-red-gold. We study history, learn, then act, fight, and love our lives.

Germany is great and beautiful. After turning the dirtiest, vilest page, Berlin rose from the ruins. But whoever wants to grant greatness to that page of shame should taste the full force of the {{< tip text="The Stasi (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit) was East Germany’s secret police and intelligence service (1950–1990), notorious for pervasive surveillance, informant networks, and political repression." variant="info" >}}Stasi’s iron fist{{< /tip >}}; should wear the handcuffs of the German police.

We must forever eradicate fascism.

其实我觉得无论什么样的德国都好，这个国家美好的一面和罪恶的一面都能反映人性，也都是我们身为人具有的东西，我们看到了，去反思就好了，即使有些人真的在辣脆德国上也找到了一些似有似无的“美好”之处，那也只代表了人性的复杂，我们的复杂和辣脆本身的复杂吧。

{{< translation>}}

I actually think that any kind of Germany is okay. Both the beautiful and the sinful aspects of this country reflect human nature—they are part of what it means to be human. We see them, and we reflect on them. Even if some people really find a faint trace of ‘beauty’ in the darkest chapters of Germany, that only represents the complexity of human nature—our own complexity mirrored in the complexities of Germany itself.

卡廷惨案死亡2.2万，根本够不上纳粹屠杀了上千万人的零头，近代以来在残暴程度上能跟纳粹比较的只有日本。况且谈纳粹关苏联什么事？

Both are crimes against humanity. The Soviet Union concealed information for so-called social stability and persecuted Jews and Poles, while Nazi Germany pursued eugenics programs and committed genocide. Personally, I don’t think there’s much point in comparing them, because there’s no need to see who was worse.

Don’t be so naive. Just like in China: when the country is in difficulty and the people are suffering, if foreigners control the economy, if the Chinese don’t target them, then who else?

真有趣。纳粹在入侵苏联期间，在短短四年时间造成了三千多万的苏联人死亡，同时期日本人造成一千八百万中国人死亡用了整整十四年。纳粹在短短六年当中，史无前例的用工业化流水线的方式造成了六百多万犹太人死亡。现在没人把这些人当人，却指着卡廷那两万人觍着脸说苏联更邪恶，有趣。
{{< translation>}}
Really interesting. During their invasion of the Soviet Union, the Nazis caused over 30 million Soviet deaths in just four years. During roughly the same period, the Japanese caused 18 million Chinese deaths over fourteen years. In just six years, the Nazis unprecedentedly used industrialized, assembly-line methods to kill over six million Jews. Now no one treats these people as humans, yet they brazenly point to the 20,000 victims of Katyn to claim the Soviet Union was more evil—interesting.

The people the Nazis killed are considered human, but those the Soviets killed are not. Peasants poisoned and conscripted during the civil war, victims of the Great Purge, countless Ukrainians who starved to death—they are not considered human. Establishing the ‘Eastern Front,’ annexing the three Baltic states, invading Finland, Poland, and Afghanistan, supporting puppet regimes in Xinjiang, the Zhenbao Island incident—all those killed or indirectly killed are not human. The ‘great and righteous’ Soviet Union only purged a group of ‘vermin’ and ‘White bandits,’ who are also considered not human.

事物都有两面性，只看到SOV的恶却看不见他的建立鼓舞了多少无产阶级，他的失败又为多少社会主义国家提供了经验，更看不到内战中的白匪坚持战争，也看不到工农剪刀差的工业成果，列宁无可置疑的伟大，斯大林的错误掩盖不了他的功绩。

Everything has two sides. Focusing only on the evil of the USSR ignores how it inspired so many proletarians, how its failures provided lessons for many socialist countries, how the White bandits persisted in the civil war, and the industrial achievements despite the peasants’ and workers’ hardships. {{< tip text="Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924): leader of the Bolshevik Revolution (1917), architect of the early Soviet state, introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP), and theorist of vanguard party strategy." variant="info" >}}Lenin{{< /tip >}} was undoubtedly great, and {{< tip text="Joseph Stalin’s legacy is contested: wartime leadership and industrial expansion alongside purges, repression, and widespread suffering." variant="info" >}}Stalin’s{{< /tip >}} mistakes cannot overshadow his accomplishments.

Iron and blood are the main colors of Germany. The Third Reich put this war machine around the neck of the entire world, so the ‘chuunibyou’ soul flares up—of course you want to hype it. Science, technology, culture, all that’s just an excuse. Once the ‘chuunibyou’ soul ignites, you can’t help but brag, and when you can’t find good reasons, you just make up all sorts of nonsense. Sometimes the sense of immersion is strong: in just two years, it destroys over a dozen countries and occupies a continent. Even if you told this in a novel, people would believe it. Sometimes, when daydreaming at home, you imagine yourself as an Austrian corporal—failing exams, wandering the streets, enlisting, reviving the country, one day becoming the Führer, returning home in glory, feeling carefree, with inner ecstasy.

这些人崇拜纳粹其实他们都在幻想这个国家是这样的：

3他们都是中国法西斯新政权的高官，过着比现在社会主义政权的贪官还要奢靡的生活，对本民族的同胞随意处置。
他们崇拜纳粹，就是因为在法西斯政权下，他们能把人类最原始的本性彻彻底底地释放出来，不用考虑法律，不用考虑道德。

(Most Nazi admirers in China are Han; for other ethnicities who admire Nazism, their reasoning is likely even more incomprehensible.)

2. The state launches aggressive wars abroad, and they can plunder other countries, sleep with women from other nations, and treat foreign peoples arbitrarily.

3. They are high-ranking officials in a fascist regime, living more extravagantly than the corrupt officials under today’s socialist system, and they can treat their own compatriots arbitrarily.

They admire the Nazis because under a fascist regime, they can completely unleash the most primal human instincts without worrying about law or morality.

Keep hyping it. I guess it goes like this: some people are drawn to the tragic destruction and terrifying peak of the Nazis and express some admiration. Then other ‘rhythm masters’ start piecing together fragmented information, and bit by bit it turns into a pro-German-army trend. Many Chinese people already liked Germany; some joined in, some criticized it, and eventually the topic blew up. And just over such trivial matters, you want to belittle others’ morality to elevate your own character. I might be mistaken in some points, but I absolutely do not think the last sentence is false.

康德 费希特 叔本华，哪一个不是反犹主义者。瓦格纳间接启发了希特勒的民族主义思想，尼采则成为了希特勒军国主义学说的代言人。更何况存在主义哲学家海德格尔直接带领960名教授效忠NSDAP。你说的马克思 罗莎卢森堡，两个犹太人。斯图尔特·张伯伦和奥斯瓦尔德·斯宾格勒这些人不见到你提过？腓特烈大帝也启发了希特勒，卡尔·施密特希特勒的法学家。这些社会思想家不一样因为战败而消失了吗？恕我直言，我厌恶现在的主流左派政治观点，我认为那一个没有《罗恩格林》和《黎恩济》的德国，那一个到处都是穆斯林还给犹太人下跪的德国，一点也不是德国。比三十年战争中的德意志更加不配称之德意志。

Kant, Fichte, Schopenhauer—none of them were anti-Semitic? Wagner indirectly inspired Hitler’s nationalist ideas, and Nietzsche became the mouthpiece for Hitler’s militaristic ideology. Moreover, the existentialist philosopher Heidegger directly led 960 professors to pledge allegiance to the NSDAP. You mentioned Marx and Rosa Luxemburg, both Jews. What about people like Stuart Chamberlain and Oswald Spengler? Didn’t you bring them up? {{< tip text="Frederick the Great (King of Prussia 1740–1786): expanded Prussia via Silesian/Seven Years’ Wars; pursued administrative, legal, and limited religious reforms; patron of Enlightenment culture." variant="info" >}}Frederick the Great{{< /tip >}} also inspired Hitler, as did Hitler’s jurist Carl Schmitt. Did these social thinkers simply disappear because Germany lost the war? Frankly, I despise the current mainstream leftist political views. I believe that a Germany without Lohengrin and Rienzi, a Germany where Muslims are everywhere bowing to Jews, is not Germany at all—less worthy of the name ‘German’ than the Germany of the Thirty Years’ War.

I admire the German military and the iron-willed spirit of Germany since the Prussian era. True ‘German army enthusiasts’ focus on the German military from 1870 to 1944; my focus is a bit broader, encompassing extensive historical and political knowledge—from the {{< tip text="Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9): Germanic coalition under Arminius ambushed and destroyed three Roman legions (XVII, XVIII, XIX), halting Roman expansion east of the Rhine." variant="info" >}}Battle of the Teutoburg Forest{{< /tip >}}, to {{< tip text="Frederick the Great (Prussian king 1740–1786): military strategist, state reformer, and Enlightenment patron who elevated Prussia to great-power status." variant="info" >}}Frederick the Great{{< /tip >}}, to the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.

写的好，但德国的伟大在于一种精神的气质，而这种气质中隐含了神圣罗马帝国的气质。这种国民精神一方面会塑造一种以天下为己任的精神，另一方面也蕴含着不稳定的铁血与征服的基因。喜欢德国喜欢的是一个立体的德国。德国的科学家在战争年代其实选择是不同的，普朗克 爱因斯坦 还有很多其他大科学家走的就是不一样的路嘛。仔细想想红胡子 {{< tip text="俾斯麦（Otto von Bismarck，1815–1898）：普鲁士首相及德意志帝国首任宰相，通过三场王朝战争实现统一，并以现实政治与早期社会立法（养老/医疗保险雏形）维护欧洲均势。" variant="info" >}}俾斯麦{{< /tip >}} 这些强人，似乎也应该是德国历史必不可少的部分。但从任何角度讲，这都是一个科学文化军事巨人辈出的国家，或许这才是一个令人敬畏喜爱的民族吧，它足够立体 足够年轻。

Well written, but Germany’s greatness lies in a certain spirit and temperament, which carries traces of the Holy Roman Empire. This national character, on one hand, fosters a sense of responsibility for the world, and on the other, contains an unstable iron-willed and conquering streak. Admiring Germany is admiring a multi-dimensional Germany. During wartime, German scientists made different choices—Planck, Einstein, and many other great scientists took very different paths. If you think carefully, strong figures like Red Beard (Frederick Barbarossa) and {{< tip text="Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898): Prussian minister-president and first Imperial Chancellor; unified Germany via limited wars (1864, 1866, 1870–71) and sustained European balance with alliance diplomacy plus pioneering social insurance." variant="info" >}}Bismarck{{< /tip >}} are also indispensable parts of German history. From any perspective, Germany is a country that has produced giants in science, culture, and the military. Perhaps that is why it is a nation both awe-inspiring and admirable—it is sufficiently multi-dimensional, sufficiently youthful.

首先，德国当时有着高度的物质文明，人人衣着体面谈吐文雅金发碧眼，符合中国人的审美观，而二战前德国辉煌的思想史、音乐史和工程史，二战时德国军人的素养和二战后德国的反思，均让国人有好感；

其次，中国历来有强者膜拜心理和英雄主义情结，德意志的铁血政策、精准要求和横扫欧亚的气场让被中庸和含糊阉割已久的国人呼吸到了新鲜空气，而它的高品质产品也让人对这个国家产生好感；

第三，德国是法西斯国家，但是对中国没有直接的伤害，相反还有些渊源，无论是二战时还是马恩还是大众，而一战的屈辱和二战的崛起让中国同情、感同身受与敬佩，甚至有些希望它的强大——相较之同为法西斯的日本以及带有喜感的意大利，德国的严谨、坦诚、反省更让国人感到亲切、友好。

{{< translation >}}
First, Germany at the time possessed a highly developed material civilization. People dressed properly, spoke elegantly, and often had blond hair and blue eyes, which fit the Chinese aesthetic ideal. Moreover, Germany’s brilliant intellectual history, musical tradition, and achievements in engineering before World War II, the discipline of its soldiers during the war, and its profound reflection after the war have all contributed to a positive impression among Chinese people.

Second, Chinese culture has long carried both a psychology of worshipping the strong and a tendency toward heroism. Germany’s {{< tip text="Refers to Germany’s reputation for militarism and strict discipline, often associated with the “Iron Chancellor” Otto von Bismarck." variant="info" >}}iron-blood policies{{< /tip >}}, strict precision, and overwhelming presence across Europe and Asia gave Chinese—who had long been constrained by moderation and ambiguity—a sense of fresh air. In addition, Germany’s high-quality products further strengthened the favorable impression of the country.

Third, although Germany was a fascist state, it did not directly inflict harm on China. In fact, there were certain historical connections, whether through cooperation during World War II, the legacy of {{< tip text="Founders of Marxist theory, both German, whose works had major influence on Chinese political ideology." variant="info" >}}Marx and Engels{{< /tip >}}, or the influence of companies such as Volkswagen. Furthermore, Germany’s humiliation in World War I and its resurgence in World War II evoked sympathy, empathy, and admiration among the Chinese, with some even hoping for its strength. Compared with Japan (also fascist, but responsible for atrocities in China) and Italy (perceived as less serious, almost comical), Germany’s rigor, sincerity, and capacity for reflection made it appear more approachable and friendly to the Chinese.

嗯，我就是各种因素结合下很喜欢德国，迷上二战史到七八处搜刮德军的书看，买了一堆看完的没几本TAT，看了《第三帝国的兴亡》和《第三帝国图文史》貌似更喜欢了，去图书馆拿到一本德国旅游彩图版类似的书详尽介绍了德国各地的风貌，甚至连地图都画好了，尼玛不外借啊啊啊啊啊

还有德国的古典音乐，莫扎特李斯特巴赫门德尔松舒曼……我不是装逼，是真的喜欢听啊

另外，没考到驾照的我也梦想开德国车……

KINDLE里一半都是德国相关的书籍，不过没看几本就是了，一定会看一定会看的！
喜欢一个事物不是一味地赞扬，而是这件事物能带我一直想发掘它，不管是好是坏

二战期间，除却纳粹大屠杀残忍到令我发指以外，对德军真的讨厌不起来，毕竟战争前期闪击波兰、轻破马奇诺防线这些战斗真可谓塑造了一个“战无不胜”的形象，全面进攻苏联的前期也把地面闪击战和装甲师的优势发挥到极致。
德军的形象，很大程度上真的是被外强中干的法国和逗比的意大利衬托出来的，一个号称欧洲陆军最强的法国40天被攻陷，一个欧洲老牌的强国意大利好像在全程负责搞笑，有英吉利海峡天然庇护着、海军实力强大的日不落帝国面对德军，也得灰头土脸地向美帝求助……
而战后德国对二战的反思及其所作所为，相比较旁边的日本，战败国的形象居然能一下子高大起来，真的是外媒评价的那句：“勃兰特一个人跪下了，所有德国人站起来了”

说起喜欢德国的原因可能很多人要提德国队
很多人是喜欢德国队才对德国感兴趣，我是因为喜欢德国，接触足球的时候才特别关注德国队进而爱上的。
身边这样的人不在少数，我爸那种伪球迷都天天在叫唤“看德国人踢球真是赏心悦目”，你问他哪里赏心悦目他说不出来，但就是莫名支持德国，说过几年要换张好的奥迪开开

喜欢有时候真是一种抽象而一言难尽的东西

{{< translation >}}
My fascination with Germany doesn’t come from a single reason, but rather from a mixture of history, culture, and personal experiences.

1. History and the Wehrmacht
I first became interested in Germany through World War II history. I’ve read books like The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and The Illustrated History of the Third Reich. The campaigns — the blitzkrieg in Poland, breaking through the Maginot Line, and the early offensive against the Soviet Union — showed the peak of military innovation in armored warfare and rapid maneuver.
Of course, the Nazi atrocities, especially the Holocaust, are something I utterly despise. But I’ve learned to separate the criminal ideology of Nazism from the military art and discipline of the German army.

2. Cultural Depth
Germany isn’t just about steel and tanks. It’s also the home of music and philosophy.
I genuinely enjoy listening to Mozart, Liszt, Bach, Mendelssohn, and Schumann. In philosophy, thinkers like Kant and Hegel alone are enough to command respect for this nation. Even though I still don’t have a driver’s license, I’ve always dreamed of driving a German car. I remember once finding a detailed illustrated travel book on Germany in the library — with maps and vivid descriptions — and being frustrated that it wasn’t available for borrowing. On my Kindle, at least half of my library is about Germany, even if I haven’t finished them all yet.

3. Reflection and Responsibility
What makes Germany stand out is how it faced its dark past. Compared to Japan, postwar Germany showed a deep sense of reflection. When Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, it wasn’t just one man’s humility — it symbolized an entire nation regaining its dignity. As one journalist put it: “One man knelt, and an entire people stood up.” That sense of responsibility is something I deeply admire.

4. Football and Everyday Appeal
Many people start liking Germany because of the national football team. For me, it was the other way around: I loved Germany first, and that made me pay closer attention to the team. Even my dad, who’s just a casual fan, says: “Watching the Germans play is a real joy.” He can’t explain why, but he always ends up rooting for them. In daily life too, “German cars” and “German engineering” have come to mean reliability and precision.

In Conclusion
To like a country doesn’t mean blind admiration. It means wanting to discover all of its dimensions — the good and the bad. For me, Germany represents a nation that is both complex and inspiring: with its military tradition, its music and philosophy, its tragic past and its honest reflection.
That depth, that multidimensional character, is exactly why I keep coming back to Germany.

因为德三二战没有和CN起直接冲突，而且主要对手又是美英苏和西方列强国，战败后到现代以来和CN关系不错，不像美苏和我们矛盾突出，所以国内某些人代入感强烈，而且军国传统，种族主义，精英治国，大扩张，复仇主义“深入人心‘’，目前，若论CN民众最讨厌的国家肯定不会有德国，和美日英俄比起来，德国带来的恶感远远不是那么强烈，但是请记住德国有很长的历史，而国内德棍高潮的那段恰恰是德国历史上最黑暗的时光

Because Nazi Germany did not have a direct military conflict with China during World War II, and its main opponents were the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, many Chinese people today feel less hostility toward Germany compared to those countries. After the war, modern Germany also maintained relatively positive relations with China, unlike the U.S. or the Soviet Union, whose confrontations with China were much sharper.

As a result, some people in China develop a sense of identification with Nazi Germany. The narratives of militarism, racial superiority, elitist governance, territorial expansion, and revenge resonate emotionally with certain groups, which leads them to glorify that period.

However, it is important to remember that Germany has a long and brilliant history—rich in philosophy, music, science, and military tradition. The period of the Third Reich, which some choose to idolize, was in fact the darkest chapter in German history.

印第安人在美洲大屠杀里只是一小部分，另外印第安人大部分也不是死于欧洲殖民者的枪，而是病毒和内斗，赏金也分很多种，大部分是开拓地发布的，和欧洲国家的本国政府联系不大，而和殖民者的利益冲突因素比较大，和纳粹的纯屠杀政策没法比（就是做奴隶工也比光杀人有用）
{{< translation >}}
Most Native Americans killed during the massacres in the Americas were only a small portion of the total casualties. The majority did not die from European colonizers’ guns, but from diseases and internal conflicts. Bounties came in many forms, mostly related to land settlement, with limited involvement from European home governments. The main driver was conflict with colonists’ interests, which makes it incomparable to the Nazis’ purely genocidal policy (even forced labor had utilitarian “purpose,” unlike outright extermination).

德国人屠犹太人就像我们也想屠了满人一样，印第安人没招惹昂撒，满人和犹太人和汉人，德意志人有极深的仇恨，汉人对满人的仇恨还要超过日俄，虽然俄国也种族灭绝了外满洲的黄种人，但屠的绝大多数是女真土著，我们看个热闹并不关心。

Although Russia also committed acts of genocide against the yellow-skinned peoples of Outer Manchuria, the vast majority of victims were indigenous Jurchens, which we observed with interest but without much personal concern.

It’s more accurate to say that we view the U.S. extermination of Native Americans and the German extermination of Jews with a learning perspective.

就种族屠杀灭绝的性质和规模而言，什么叫没法比？在我看来都是一样的，而且欧美殖民者造成的死亡人数远远高于纳粹杀犹太人！至于你统计的大多数死于天花和内斗，也是严重缺乏事实和统计依据，可以公认的是是由于欧洲人踏上新大陆后一系列扩张、开拓荒地也包括对土著的屠杀和冲突等一系列连贯阶段性的历史事件，包括对人家以前纯粹原生态生活环境的极大破坏才导致美洲土著减少绝大部分！就算有不少不是死于直接屠杀，根本上也和欧洲人的到来导致对他们生态生存自然环境的改造破坏密不可分，这个锅当然得欧洲殖民者背！至于你说的和欧洲本国政府关系不大，我也不大认同。哪怕只要是殖民者相应本国国王/征服的号召、鼓励，或者出台的某项政策政令的纵容、支持，都可以说本质上是基于统治者的引导决策。非要说犹太人大屠杀和美洲大屠杀不同只有两点不同，手段不同，一个更多的是凭借枪炮，另一个更多的是工业化流水线杀人。其次是纳粹屠杀有系统成文的纲领理论作指导，而欧美殖民者却没有罢了。

In terms of the nature and scale of racial massacres and exterminations, what does “incomparable” even mean? In my view, they are essentially the same, and the death toll caused by European and American colonizers far exceeded that of the Nazis’ killing of Jews. As for your claim that most deaths were due to smallpox and internal conflicts, that seriously lacks factual and statistical support. What can be generally recognized is that after Europeans set foot on the New World, a series of expansionist and land-clearing actions—including massacres and conflicts with indigenous peoples—along with the massive disruption of their previously pristine ecological environments, caused the drastic decline of Native American populations. Even if many did not die from direct killings, it was fundamentally inseparable from the ecological and environmental destruction brought by the arrival of Europeans, for which the European colonizers must bear responsibility.

Regarding your point that it had little to do with European home governments, I also disagree. Even if the colonizers were acting under the call, encouragement, or tacit support of their kings or imperial authorities, it can be said that the actions were essentially guided by the rulers’ decisions.

So, if one insists that the Holocaust and the massacres in the Americas are different, there are only two main distinctions: the methods and the systematic guidance. One relied more on guns and sporadic violence, while the other was an industrialized, top-down killing process. Secondly, the Nazi extermination was guided by a systematic, codified ideological plan, whereas the European colonizers did not have such a formalized policy.
