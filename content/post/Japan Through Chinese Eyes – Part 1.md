  <strong class="translated-label">OP:</strong>
While China’s animosity toward Japan stems largely from historical trauma—the invasion and atrocities of the past—the question remains: why do some Japanese harbor resentment toward China today? Is it history, politics, or the fear of a rising neighbor?

中国孱弱的时候，日本“喜欢”中国。

中国成长起来，日本开始讨厌中国。

等到中国真正强大起来，日本就该恐惧中国了。

现在讨厌，是因为中国还没有足够强大。

When China was weak, Japan “liked” China.
As China began to grow, Japan started to dislike it.
And when China becomes truly powerful, Japan will learn to fear it.
The current dislike simply shows that China isn’t strong enough—yet.

[吃瓜]中国对日来说，已经足够强大了，为什么还没到恐惧，不知你有没有看过被主人拉着牵引绳的小狗狂吠不止，而一旦主人放开牵引绳时，那狗立马就缩回主人脚下了～就是这个道理～

China is already strong enough to make Japan uneasy. But why hasn’t that turned into real fear yet?
Think of it like a dog on a leash—barking furiously as long as its owner is holding the rope.
The moment the leash is released, the dog instantly retreats behind its master.
That’s pretty much the same logic here.

理由确实差不多。但如果深究起来，没有一个国家希望别国强大，因为强国总会威胁自己，就算是美国的诸多盟友，又有几个真心实意的，也不是因为暂时的利益而结合。

<div class="translated-text">
The reasons are indeed similar. But if you look deeper, no country truly wants another to become too powerful.
A rising power is always seen as a potential threat.
Even among America’s many allies, how many of those relationships are built on genuine trust rather than temporary interests?

我偏个题，对日本不是讨厌，是仇恨。
但凡脑子正常点的就明白，日本在二战期间，是想对我们进行种族灭绝的。
人类历史上打打杀杀基本没有停过。
成王败寇，大家为了利益，为了资源，从盟友变敌人，又从敌人变盟友。
唯独仇人，不可利益交换。

日本从来没有认为是中国击败了他。
我们也没有要求日本对我们进行战争赔偿。
说明这事，没完。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Let me digress for a moment — my feeling toward Japan isn’t dislike, it’s hatred.
Anyone with a sense of history knows that during World War II, Japan’s ambition in China went far beyond conquest — it was close to genocide.
Human history has always been filled with wars. Nations fight, rise and fall, switch from allies to enemies and back again — all for interests and resources.
But there’s one exception: hatred. True hatred cannot be traded for profit.
Japan has never really believed it was China that defeated it.
And China, for its part, never demanded war reparations.
That means this chapter of history isn’t truly closed.

评论区都是民族主义者啊，实际上绝大多数日本人讨厌中国人的情况还没有太久的历史，在我国社会主义建设时期，日本青年可是毛泽东思想的坚决维护者，扩大了日本左翼势力。后来呢由于改开，很多中核派青年都放弃了斗争，再加上后来苏联解体，导致日本左翼陷入低谷，自此日本右翼分子掌权日本政府，对左翼的打压，对舆论的控制（教育上的），但这不代表日本没有左翼群众，什么哆啦A梦，奥特曼，宫崎骏的作品等等，讨厌中国的日本人就是右翼分子和没有政治立场的，不承认侵华战争的还是他们，我不建议你站在把一个国家所有的人的思想看成一个整体的角度去看待这个问题

The comment section is full of nationalists, but in reality, Japan’s widespread hostility toward China is a fairly recent phenomenon.
During China’s socialist construction period, many young Japanese were actually staunch supporters of Mao Zedong’s thought, which helped expand Japan’s left-wing movements at the time.
However, after China’s reform and opening-up, many of those radical leftists abandoned their activism.
The collapse of the Soviet Union further weakened Japan’s left, paving the way for right-wing forces to dominate Japanese politics.
Since then, the right has tightened control over education and the media — but that doesn’t mean there are no left-leaning voices in Japan.
Think of works like Doraemon, Ultraman, or Miyazaki Hayao’s films — they all reflect a more idealistic, humanist worldview.
The Japanese who openly express hostility toward China today are mostly right-wingers or politically apathetic citizens.
Those who deny the wartime invasion of China? They’re the same group.
So, it’s misguided to view an entire nation’s people as sharing one unified mindset.

汉人擅长选择性的铭记仇恨，当年蒙古人屠了七千多万汉人，满清人砍了一亿汉人，这些仇恨不亚于日本大和人，可是汉人的后代谁还提过？
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
The Han people are skilled at selectively remembering their grudges.
Centuries ago, the Mongols killed over 70 million Han, and the Qing regime slaughtered around 100 million.
These historical grievances are no less severe than those against the Japanese.
Yet, how many descendants of the Han even bring them up today?

我经常跟日本朋友说：“日本国王是皇明中央帝国万历帝册封的，指定是丰臣秀吉，跟你们你们天皇半毛钱关系都没有，你们的天皇没得到过中央帝国册封，所以他不具有法理正统地位，也因此当今伪日本政府不合法。你们日本年轻人必须有觉悟去推翻当今伪日本政府的统治，建立符合正道秩序的法统日本。如果你们办不到，中华人民共和国有权代表中央帝国正道秩序替你们做主。”
每次都成功激怒对方[惊喜]

<div class="translated-text">
I often tell my Japanese friends: “The title of ‘King of Japan’ was granted by the Ming central empire — the Wanli Emperor appointed Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It has nothing to do with your current Emperor. Your emperor never received investiture from the central empire, so he has no legitimate dynastic claim; therefore today’s pseudo‑Japanese government is illegitimate. You young Japanese must wake up, overthrow the current fake government, and restore a Japan that follows the proper dynastic order. If you can’t do it, the People’s Republic of China has the right to stand in for the central empire and make that decision for you.”

It never fails to rile them up.

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598)

Japanese military leader and politician who unified Japan in the late 16th century.

Rose from humble origins to become daimyo (feudal lord) and de facto ruler of Japan.

Led the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), which were also aimed at projecting power toward China.

Known for implementing social reforms, such as the separation of warriors and farmers, and strict class policies.

A highly influential historical figure, often considered one of the “Three Unifiers of Japan” alongside Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu.

我们不讨厌日本人啊，只是深恶痛绝日本的军国主义。日本人因为美国的宣传以及军国主义的长期侵蚀，慢慢的开始以为中国人太强势故意欺负他们。实际上年轻一代的日本人并不认为是他们的祖辈犯下战争罪，据说TMD教科书都是美国人写的

We don’t hate Japanese people — we deeply detest Japanese militarism.
Due to long-term exposure to militaristic ideology and U.S. propaganda, some Japanese have come to believe that the Chinese are bullying them because we’re “too strong.”
In reality, most young Japanese don’t hold their ancestors responsible for wartime crimes.
Allegedly, many of the textbooks are written by Americans anyway.

To be clear, Chinese dislike of the Japanese isn’t primarily about the invasion itself.
It’s more about the insecurity that comes from failing to stand up when faced with reality — using “anti-Japanese sentiment” as a seemingly indisputable justification.
Just look at what these so-called “anti-Japanese activists” actually do. Do they dare touch Japanese assets in China? Or confront the thugs who violently assault Chinese women? Not a word.
Remember: if Japanese companies leave, all their employees lose jobs. Who helps them find work? Government tax revenue drops — who compensates the officials?

三年前，我在Hello Talk上认识了一个日本人。

起因是我发了一条动态，我问日本人是不是有很多在考HSK4级的，然后有个日本人私信我说他在学中文，正在准备4级考试。

一开始，他说他很喜欢去中国旅游，他感慨中国太大了。

后来聊到了工作，他当时是说在日本某个岛上工作，具体做什么我忘了。

然后乱七八糟聊了一堆，我问他知道中日当年爆发的战争吗？他说不知道，我说就是1931年的侵华战争啊！他只说他并不清楚，而且他不是学历史的，对历史也没兴趣。然后他又说希望不要打战，打战对谁都不好。我继续问，你们年轻人难道对近代史一点了解都没有吗？比如南京大屠杀、日本在中国的杀戮、日军和美军作战等等，他说那还是有一点了解的，日本大部分老年人（也就是经历过二战时期的人）都认为日本是败给了米国，而不是败给了中国。他以前看过关于老兵的采访，老兵说当年中国士兵武器太差了，但是中国士兵战斗意志非常顽强，如果有和日军同样的武器就可能不会被侵略了……

他又说:但是这些事情跟我们又有什么关系呢？就算以前我们祖辈真的侵略了中国那也是它们那辈人的事，我们只不过是他们的后代而已。

这就是普通日本人的观念，大部分年轻人根本不关心政治历史，就算有点了解也是一副无所谓的态度，他们更愿意去看动漫，玩游戏。

然后它对我说我们所谓的南京大屠杀在它看来不像是真实的，它说:你们每年的人数都在变，一下说杀了三十万，一下说死了四十万，我不相信。我说如果你以后有机会来中国旅游可以去南京看看，也许会颠覆你的想法。

它说据它所知，中国也有很多喜欢日本的人。因为它自己周边就认识一些在日生活的中国人。然后跟我分享了一件事，说是它在上大学期间，有几个中国的女留学生在它班上成绩很好，同学们都很佩服。有一次它们升国旗要求在场的日本人都站起来唱它们的国歌，如果有外国人在场只需站起来就行，不需要唱歌，然后那几个女留学生非要跟着一起唱。它跟我说了这么一句话:看来你们中国的留学生真的很爱我们日本啊！

我一时语塞，竟不知道怎么回答，然后想了一下说，可能是那几个留学生喜欢日本吧？他说我看不像，如果中国没有很多人喜欢日本，为什么每年都有很多中国游客来我们这里旅游呢？我们的商店都挤满了中国人，一些家用电器都快被中国游客买光了，有一次我想去买一个电饭煲，售货员告诉我已经卖完……

最后，它给我看了一张日本对华民意投票表，91%的日本人都投了讨厌中国人。它说了一句，这才是日本人对中国人真正的想法。然后又说，我站在你的角度来思考一下，你一直跟我说日本入侵了中国，假如我是中国人，我会认为日本是一个资源匮乏的岛国，还有海啸地震，那么只能对外扩张。而且日本这么小的一个国家却能占领中国那么多土地，而且还能跟米国对抗，难道不觉得日本人很厉害吗？据我所知你们的第一代领导人还夸奖过我们是优秀的民族。

我说，在某些方面你们确实是很优秀，我也承认。但你们否认历史事实，歪曲历史真相那就是令人愤怒的，无耻的。

它说，如果中国真的能比现在的米国还强大，也许我们的媒体会承认你们所说的“那些过错”。

我当时就很奇怪明明它们才是加害国，它们侵略中国，屠杀我们的老百姓，它们居然还还讨厌中国人，它们有什么理由讨厌中国人？

它说日本的几乎所有的新闻媒体每次都挑选中国负面事情报道，正面新闻几乎是看不到的。所以老百姓普遍认为中国还是几十年前一样经济落后、人民贫困、空气污染，虽然也会偶尔报道现在中国的飞速发展，但对老百姓的影响并不大。中国的抗日剧倒是能在电视上看到，他很惊讶的问我，你们以前八路军看起来好厉害，一个人可以打好几个人！

以上就是他的解释，大概就是这个意思。

我于是问他，你是因为什么原因想学中文，想来中国？他说现在的中国强的可怕，虽然跟米国还有差距，但如果不跟中国人搞好关系以后会很麻烦。后来不知道怎么回事又聊到棒子，他说チョン就是个自大又不要脸的人种，チョン是日本人对韩国人的蔑称，有点类似于我们蔑称韩国人是高丽棒子一样的意思。在日本，对韩国人的蔑称通常包括“チョーセンジン”（朝鲜人）和チョン（微不足道的棒子）。什么都要偷，又没有体育精神，明明是个小国，非要称自己是“大韩民国”，非常不要脸。

于是我问他，那日本人更讨厌中国人还是韩国人？

他思索了一下，缓缓说了一句，那可能还是中国人。我问为什么？他是这样说的:现在日韩两国都是米国的盟友，你知道的，我们都没有什么主权，所以在政治上我们是属于统一战线，而且我们都是资本主义国家。在生活上我们两国饮食和文化也比较相似，所以普通日本民众要按厌恶排名的话，第一是中国，第二是韩国。

我很奇怪日本人到底是个什么样的人种？他告诉我:日本是单一民族，很排外。优点是善于学习，怕惹麻烦，很有自尊心；缺点是冷漠，自私，很有坏心眼，而且一切都以自我为中心。他举个例子说:如果有日本人向你鞠躬并不代表它尊敬你，而且也不能算是礼貌，这是我们从小就养成了鞠躬的习惯，如果你上网就能看到很多日本人在网络上宣泄自己的怨恨，你可以看做是虚伪吧！我们本国人也会相互嘲讽，所以我很不喜欢这种氛围。

他突然问了我一句:听说你们中国人娶妻子要花很多钱，是这样吗？

我说每个地方都不一样，有些地方要很多钱，有些地方不用钱，因人而异。

然后他给我发了一个大笑的表情，他对我说:在我们日本人看来，女人是要被男人征服的，如果跪下来花钱讨好女人，在我们大部分人看来是嗤之以鼻的。你们如果能学会控制女人，利用女人，她们就会听你的话，你的生活就会过得很舒服，至少在生活中不用自己洗衣做饭。我们日本人天生有对强者的崇拜，对弱者我们不会同情的。

日本人其实也看不起韩国人，虽然同是米国的狗，日本人觉得当年二战他们殖民过南朝鲜半岛，棒子是它们统治领地下的奴隶，在鬼子眼里全亚洲都是属于它们的，其他人都是劣等人种。

当然现在的棒子也不是什么好东西。

这就是普通日本人对中国人的看法。

Three years ago, I met a Japanese person on HelloTalk.

It started when I posted a status asking if many Japanese people were taking the HSK Level 4 exam. A Japanese person messaged me privately saying he was learning Chinese and preparing for Level 4.

At first, he said he really liked traveling to China and marveled at how huge the country was.

Later we talked about work. He said he was working on some island in Japan, though I forgot the specifics.

Then we chatted about all sorts of things. I asked him if he knew about the war between China and Japan. He said no. I clarified, “You mean the invasion of China in 1931?” He said he wasn’t really sure, he’s not a history student, and he’s not interested in history. He added that he hoped there would be no wars — war is bad for everyone.

I pressed on: “Don’t young people in Japan know anything about modern history? Like the Nanjing Massacre, Japanese killings in China, or battles between Japanese and American forces?” He said he knew a little. Most elderly Japanese — those who lived through WWII — think Japan lost to the U.S., not China. He had seen interviews with veterans who said that Chinese soldiers were poorly armed but had incredibly strong fighting spirit. If they had had the same weapons as the Japanese, they might not have been invaded.

He said, “But what does this have to do with us? Even if our ancestors really invaded China, that was their generation. We’re just their descendants.”

This is the typical mindset of ordinary Japanese. Most young people don’t care about politics or history. Even if they know a little, they’re indifferent and prefer watching anime or playing games.

Then he told me he personally doesn’t think the Nanjing Massacre is real. “Every year the numbers change. One year it’s 300,000, another year 400,000. I don’t believe it.” I said, “If you ever visit Nanjing, it might change your mind.”

He said, to his knowledge, there are also many Chinese people who like Japan. He knows some Chinese people living in Japan. He shared a story: back in university, a few Chinese female students did very well in class, earning everyone’s admiration. One day, during a flag-raising ceremony, all Japanese students were required to stand and sing their national anthem if a foreigner was present; the Chinese students insisted on singing along. He said, “Wow, those Chinese students really love Japan!”

I was momentarily speechless and said maybe those students just personally liked Japan. He replied, “Doesn’t seem like it. If many Chinese didn’t like Japan, why are so many Chinese tourists visiting every year? Our shops are packed with them. Some household appliances are almost bought out. Once I wanted to buy a rice cooker, and the clerk said it was sold out…”

Finally, he showed me a Japanese public opinion poll about China. 91% of Japanese respondents said they disliked Chinese people. He said, “This is what Japanese people really think about Chinese.” Then he added, “Think from your perspective. You keep telling me Japan invaded China. If I were Chinese, I’d see Japan as a resource-poor island prone to earthquakes and tsunamis, forced to expand outward. And Japan, such a small country, managed to occupy so much Chinese territory and even confront the U.S. — don’t you think that’s impressive? I’ve heard your first-generation leaders even praised our nation as excellent.”

I said, “In some aspects, yes, you are very capable. But denying and distorting historical facts is infuriating and shameless.”

He said, “If China were stronger than the U.S., maybe our media would admit the ‘mistakes’ you talk about.”

I found it strange. They were the aggressors, invading China and massacring our people, yet they also dislike Chinese people. What reason could they possibly have?

He explained that almost all Japanese news media selectively report negative news about China. Positive news is almost invisible. So ordinary Japanese think China is still poor, backward, and polluted as it was decades ago. Occasionally, media report China’s rapid development, but it doesn’t impact the general public much. He mentioned that he had seen Chinese anti-Japanese TV dramas. He laughed, saying, “Wow, your Eighth Route Army soldiers look amazing — one person taking on several enemies!”

I asked why he wanted to learn Chinese and visit China. He said, “China is incredibly strong now. Still behind the U.S., but if we don’t maintain good relations, it will be troublesome later.”

Then somehow we got onto Koreans. He said, “チョン is an arrogant and shameless type.” (チョン Chon is a derogatory Japanese term for Koreans, similar to calling Koreans “Goryeo sticks” in Chinese.) He explained that Japanese slurs against Koreans include “チョーセンジン” (Chōsenjin) and “チョン” (Chon). “They steal everything, lack sportsmanship, and despite being a small country, call themselves the ‘Republic of Korea.’ Shameless.”

I asked him whether Japanese dislike Chinese or Koreans more. He thought for a moment and said, “Probably Chinese.” I asked why. He explained that Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. are allies. Politically, they’re in a united front and both are capitalist countries. Culturally and in daily life, Japan and Korea are more similar. So if ordinary Japanese were to rank their dislike, first would be China, second Korea.

I asked about Japanese people as a group. He said Japan is a single, homogeneous, and rather exclusive nation. Strengths: quick learners, avoid trouble, self-respecting. Weaknesses: cold, selfish, cunning, self-centered. He gave an example: “If a Japanese person bows to you, it doesn’t mean respect or courtesy — it’s just a habit we’ve been taught since childhood. Online, you can see many Japanese venting their resentment; you might call it hypocrisy. We also mock each other, so I don’t like this atmosphere.”

He suddenly asked: “I heard Chinese men spend a lot to marry a wife. Is that true?”

I said it varies by region; some places require a lot, others don’t, it depends on the person.

He sent a laughing emoji 😅 and said: “In Japan, women are meant to be conquered by men. Kneeling and spending money to please them is looked down upon. If you learn to control and use women, they’ll obey, and your life will be comfortable. At least you won’t have to do laundry or cook.”

He explained that Japanese naturally admire the strong and don’t sympathize with the weak.

He also looked down on Koreans. Even though both Japan and South Korea are U.S. allies, Japanese think that during WWII, Koreans were their colonial subjects — slaves under Japanese rule. In the eyes of the Japanese, all of Asia belonged to them; others were inferior.

Of course, he added, modern Koreans aren’t exactly great either.

That’s basically how an ordinary Japanese person sees Chinese people.

跟优待俘虏没啥关系，优待俘虏是我党的阳谋，旨在用最低成本瓦解敌人。kmt优待战犯为的是对付我党。说白了，当年他们不怕中国完全是洗脑洗的太彻底，而现在他们可不傻，谁强谁弱心里门清，故意装糊涂以掩饰心虚

It had nothing to do with lenient treatment of POWs. That clemency was the CCP’s open tactic — a deliberate, low‑cost strategy to undermine the enemy. The KMT’s leniency toward war criminals, by contrast, was meant to be used against the CCP.
Frankly, back then they weren’t afraid of China because the propaganda had brainwashed them so thoroughly.
Today they’re not that stupid — they know exactly who’s strong and who’s weak. They just play dumb on purpose to hide their own insecurity.

No need for any “repentance.” Looking at history longitudinally, the Xiongnu and Turkic peoples have long become mere historical names, both destroyed by the two strongest dynasties of their times. The Liao, Jin, Western Xia, Mongols, and Later Jin eventually became part of history too, through war and assimilation.
So, realistically speaking, it didn’t take long for those two names to turn into historical footnotes.

There are still objective differences. Nomadic peoples, being less advanced, could be assimilated and transformed by our more developed agrarian civilization, and even internally weakened.
But Japan, after the Meiji Restoration, had already Westernized — part of its culture was replaced or destroyed, yet some traditions remained.
The window for fully assimilating them civilizationally has long passed. During the Tang dynasty, it might have been possible. Now, only by reaching the top in comprehensive national strength and military power could suppression even be conceivable.
But judging by just technological and R&D capabilities, the gap makes that impossible within the next few decades.

我不知道是我表述有问题还是你的理解有问题。我是说日本这个名字没有太多年的存在了。至于他们的文化和政体，实话实说，还处于中国春秋前的样子，只不过批了现代生产力的壳子，除了东京都地区和大阪地区，都是这样子，封建主换成县长，名字换了而已，其他是真的大差不差，他们的封闭岛国的地理环境，决定他们的性格，更是让他们不可能往下进化政体和文化，鬼神的干扰和无路可退的性格，连春秋的政体都到不了，所谓的战国时代放到中国也就是上世纪村镇抢资源的混战规模，那算什么战国……自己进化不了谁去影响都没用。

还有，你那科研代差是什么老黄历了，就光盯着诺贝尔医学奖是吗，要知道，这个奖的滞后性可是动则三四十年，而且吃的是东北干的龌龊事的老本，现在他们的教授想要项目能进行，只能来中国才有钱，他们的政府大多数根本都不会给了。况且现在高精尖领域中国大多数已经攻克，除了大型运载火箭和光刻机等等几个超精尖还在和美国斗外，其他的日本根本就上不了台面了好不好

I’m not sure whether it’s my wording or your understanding, but what I mean is that the name “Japan” hasn’t existed for very long. As for their culture and political system, frankly speaking, it’s still roughly at the level of China before the Spring and Autumn period — just wrapped in the shell of modern productivity.
Except for Tokyo and Osaka, it’s basically the same: feudal lords replaced by governors, names changed, but everything else largely unchanged. Their closed-island geography shaped their character and makes it impossible for their political system and culture to evolve naturally. With superstition and a “nowhere to retreat” mentality, they never even reach a Spring and Autumn–era system. Their so-called Warring States period? In China, it would be comparable to chaotic village-level struggles for resources in the last century — hardly worthy of the name. No internal evolution means outside influence doesn’t help.

And as for that so-called technological gap you mentioned — that’s old news. Just looking at Nobel Prizes in Medicine is misleading; the lag is typically 30–40 years, and they mostly relied on past achievements in Northeast Asia. Nowadays, if their professors want funding for projects, they have to come to China — their own government rarely provides it.
Moreover, China has already mastered most cutting-edge fields. Except for a few ultra-advanced areas like heavy-lift rockets and photolithography, Japan simply can’t compete on the world stage anymore.

Put simply: countries that tell history as a national story struggle to repent — ethnic narratives force everyone, past and present, to carry collective guilt, and that fractures society.
Use a class narrative instead, and the problem disappears: blame the old ruling class. Once they’re gone, reconciliation is easier — many ordinary people’s interests now cut across borders.

What about Germany?

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
**Historical Accountability: China, Japan, and Germany**
When comparing how nations deal with past wars, the differences between Japan and Germany are striking. Germany, after World War II, went through a structured process of accountability. The Nuremberg Trials held Nazi leaders legally responsible, and the country institutionalized “Vergangenheitsbewältigung” — a culture of confronting the past. German schools teach the atrocities, governments issue formal apologies, and reparations have been made. Most Germans today accept the historical facts and pass them on to the next generation, making reflection and contrition a societal norm.

Japan, on the other hand, shows a different pattern. While there have been official apologies for wartime aggression, these gestures are often seen as politically motivated or insufficient. Many young Japanese have limited knowledge of their country’s actions during the Second World War, and a deep, society-wide mechanism for remorse is largely absent. The combination of selective historical education, political narratives, and external protection by allies like the United States means that historical reckoning is partial and uneven.

For China, which was victimized by Japanese aggression, this difference shapes contemporary perceptions. German society’s institutionalized acknowledgment allows for a sense of closure over time, whereas Japan’s partial acknowledgment, coupled with selective historical narratives, perpetuates mistrust and resentment. Simply put: Germany demonstrates “proactive acknowledgment and systemic reflection,” while Japan leans toward “partial acknowledgment with political control,” leaving young generations less aware and less remorseful.

必须打的他们不敢冒头才行。

正常来讲日本作为罄竹难书的刽子手，应该彻底清算，干坏事的全死刑，抢的金银财宝吐出来，结果，没有。只有少数几个首恶分子判死刑，几十个人，其他人还在日本政坛风生水起，包括安倍也是军国主义分子后代；金银财宝，噗嗤，战争赔款都没赔。主要是美国人觉得日本在对抗苏联和中国方面大有用处，所以，清算不彻底。这是日本的国运，没办法。但是国运到底是好事还是坏事？因为清算不彻底，所以还在咋咋呼呼，最终，给他们民族招来灭顶之灾的可能性，也存在。且等着吧。

Germany lost: Soviet and American forces entered the homeland, the capital fell, and Soviet troops committed massive rapes and killings in Berlin — revenge was taken, grievances were returned.
That wasn’t the end. The Germans slaughtered the most Jews. Backed by Britain and the U.S., the Jews established Israel, then launched a global hunt for Nazi perpetrators. Anyone proved to be a Nazi was pursued. Even in X‑Men you have Professor X tracking down the Nazi officer who killed his parents in South America.
They had to be beaten back so they wouldn’t dare show their faces.
By rights, Japan — a monstrous executioner — should have faced a thorough reckoning: the perpetrators executed, stolen gold and treasures returned, war reparations paid. Instead, only a handful of top criminals were executed; dozens, while guilty, went on to thrive in Japanese politics (including descendants of militarists like Abe). War loot wasn’t returned; reparations were not fully paid.
The main reason: the Americans found Japan useful against the Soviet Union and China, so the purge was left incomplete. That’s Japan’s national fate — unavoidable.
Whether that fate is good or bad is another question. Because the reckoning was incomplete, they still strut about loudly, and there’s a real possibility this will bring catastrophic consequences upon the nation. Wait and see.

That statement needs correction. While some perpetrators never repented, the lenient treatment of POWs was not simply pampering. Prisoners were regularly gathered for confession‑style sessions where they were made to recount the atrocities they had committed.
This process resembled postwar re‑education: many POWs lived in constant guilt, and some even took their own lives. Those who survived and returned home often became staunch anti‑war activists and proponents of documenting the history of the conflict.

中日1972年建交，改革开放后大批日企对华投资，中日进入蜜月期，日本赚钱中国学技术，这样过了三十年，然后这两年开始宣扬对日仇恨，然后就开始各种灭岛言论，不觉得很奇怪么。 沙俄在中国干的坏事，满清对义和团 太平天国的镇压，这些残暴程度不比日本差吧，形势需求，就没有报复言论了。

<div class="translated-text">
China and Japan established diplomatic relations in 1972. After China’s reform and opening-up, a large number of Japanese companies invested in China. For thirty years, it was a “honeymoon period”: Japan made money, and China learned technology. Then, in the past couple of years, anti-Japanese sentiment has been promoted, along with all sorts of “island-eradication” rhetoric. Doesn’t that seem strange?
Look at Russia’s bad deeds in China, or the Qing dynasty’s brutal suppression of the Boxers and the Taiping Rebellion — these were no less violent than Japan’s actions. But due to situational necessity, there has been no widespread call for revenge.

不是的，也许外国人真的就是这样想的。认识一个非常亲近的韩国朋友，但是他好像完全不在意日本曾经殖民过韩国，而且表示韩国人最讨厌的是中国人。我觉得很奇怪，就问他，日本人曾经也侵略过韩国，为什么你看起来好像完全不在意？他的回答和这个日本人一样，觉得这是很多年前发生的事情了，也许老一辈人会在意，但是包括他在内的很多韩国人都觉得现在日韩关系不错，因此没有必要再在乎这件事了。

Maybe foreigners really do think like this. I know a very close Korean friend, and he seems completely unconcerned about Japan having colonized Korea in the past.

His answer was just like that of the Japanese person I know: it happened a long time ago. Maybe the older generation cares, but many Koreans, including him, think that current Japan-Korea relations are fine, so there’s no need to dwell on it.

Let’s skip the side issues. Even if public attitudes change over time, the state must acknowledge its wrongs. Textbooks should be subject to independent review, and the country must refrain from developing offensive military capabilities and accept international inspections. If those two conditions are met, then there is no moral basis to punish contemporary citizens for the deeds of their ancestors — whether people personally like each other becomes secondary.

Modern Japan is basically under US control. After World War II, the US used both carrot and stick: they brought the emperor down from his pedestal while flooding the media with the narrative that America is the righteous savior. Anyone who didn’t comply got punished.
So for ordinary Japanese, the first thought about the US is “ally.” And since the US is anti-China, Japan naturally follows its master and adopts the same stance. As for the war against China, they’ll never admit it, no matter what.

但是“人”应该有基本认知，比如成吉思汗当年把元朝版图扩张到欧洲很厉害，但我们都知道那片土地当时并不是荒无人烟，元朝的扩张本质就是在侵犯别人领土。可是日本人并不从客观去思考，既然是“共荣”为什么有战火，既然是“帮助”为什么那么多人恨他们，既然他们发动的战争无罪，当年东京军事法庭审判的战争犯罪名如何成立？ 就是纯坏罢了

But people should have some basic common sense. Sure, Genghis Khan expanded the Yuan dynasty’s territory all the way to Europe, and that was impressive — but we all know those lands weren’t empty. The expansion was essentially an invasion. Japanese, however, don’t think objectively. If it was really “co-prosperity,” why was there war? If it was really “help,” why did so many hate them? If their wars were innocent, how did the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal even convict them? They were just plain bad.

太在乎所谓的面子，国际上的看法。我刚上班的时候也是这种想法，总是担心做的事情能不能让领导满意，会不会得罪同事，包括现在都还有这种想法。这就是刻在中国人骨子里的儒家思想。
现在的00后真的不在乎这些东西，所以他们才能整顿职场。我带过几个实习生，他们真的不会太在乎领导对他们的看法。

We’ve always cared too much about “face” and what the world thinks. When I first started working, I had the same mindset—always worrying whether my actions would please my boss or offend colleagues. Honestly, I still think like that sometimes. This is deeply rooted in Confucian thought.

But the post-2000 generation really doesn’t care about these things, which is why they can shake up the workplace. I’ve supervised a few interns, and they genuinely aren’t too concerned about what their managers think.

You can force the government to apologize, you can make the Emperor apologize — but you can’t make an ordinary Japanese person apologize. If my great‑grandfather murdered someone, and the victim’s family came after me, I wouldn’t apologize either.

Right now, Japan neither admits nor shows remorse. They only distort the facts of past actions and have no compassion for the Chinese who died. If your grandfather had killed someone, everyone within miles would have known — yet Japan deliberately tries to downplay the traces of history.

What’s the point of arguing with them… This is just a difference in standpoint. Expecting someone to completely reverse their stance is unrealistic. I support you calling them out directly, but insisting they admit they or their government were wrong? That’s a bit crazy. In other words, when your ancestors expanded territory and incorporated lands like Fusang or Goryeo into their ancient domain, would you feel guilty about it? Same principle.

**Fusang** refers to a legendary land or island to the east of ancient China, mentioned in Chinese historical texts. It sometimes broadly represents Japan or the unknown regions of the Far East in historical discussions.

这个我同意，说实话人民是无辜的，他们始终被政府洗脑，他们的态度其实就是政府的态度，我刚看到是很气愤的，很讨厌他们这个自私自大的小人民族。但是后面转念一想韩国不也是这样吗，偷国的出现不就是政府支持人民造历史，抢文化。如若真的打起来，你可以打政府，打天皇，打军队，但不能打人民百姓就是这个道理。但是我还是要说日本做事人民百姓这个角度日本纯史

I agree. Honestly, ordinary people are innocent — they've been brainwashed by their government, and their attitudes often just mirror official lines. At first I was furious and despised these self‑centered little nationalists, but then I thought: isn't Korea the same? The rise of nationalism is often state‑driven — governments manufacture history and rob culture.
If war ever breaks out, you can target the government, the emperor, the military — not ordinary civilians. Still, from the perspective of how Japan operates at the popular level, I have to say their people bear a lot of historical blame.

我想问的是，如果有一天中国武统了日本，实行统一行政文化融合民族融合，就像几千年来中华民族不停在做的事情一样，到那时候政府导向的舆论会是怎么样的，是杀光日寇子嗣报仇雪恨还是全民族一家亲。中国历史上民族对民族的屠杀并不罕见，中日血统也没有那么远，毕竟现在国内还有不少白种异语的少数民族依旧被归为中华民族的一部分。

<div class="translated-text">
I wonder, if one day China were to unify Japan under its administration, implementing integrated governance, cultural assimilation, and ethnic fusion — much like the Chinese have historically done with various peoples over the millennia — how would the state-directed narratives look at that time? Would the official line be “exterminate the descendants of the Japanese invaders to avenge past atrocities,” or would it be “all peoples of one nation, living together in harmony”?
Historically, interethnic massacres were not uncommon in China. The bloodlines between Chinese and Japanese are not so distant either; even today, many ethnically European or linguistically distinct minorities are recognized as part of the Chinese nation.

我其实不讨厌日本，我还很喜欢它。它的音乐，手工绘画，成人漫画和片。
我也想过，如果说，有了机会，我们打过去，我们应不应该想他们对我们前辈做出的事那样。
答案是不能的。
如果和野兽做一样的事情，那就和野兽无异了，我们对野兽要做的事情是驯服，而不是去把野兽做过的事做一遍。
对于猫，要阉割，对于狗，要打骂。
对于日本人，我觉得要像美国人对他们那样才是对的。
一口一个杀光日本人的人，我觉得脑子可以有点问题，大概率只是用情感思考问题的，这和野兽也差不多。
犹太人都杀不完，何况日本人呢？
杀的意义只是泄愤，而不是复仇。

I don't actually hate Japan; I actually like it. Its music, handmade paintings, and adult manga and movies.

I've also wondered: if we had the chance and were to attack them, should we do what they did to our ancestors?

The answer is no.

If we do the same things as wild animals, we're no different from wild animals. We should tame wild animals, not repeat what they did.

Cats should be castrated, and dogs should be beaten and scolded.

As for the Japanese, I think the right thing to do is to treat them the way the Americans treat them.

Those who keep calling for the death of all Japanese have a mental problem. They're probably just thinking out of their own emotions, just like wild animals.

We couldn't even kill all the Jews, so what about the Japanese?

Killing is about venting anger, not revenge.

There's not much difference. Aren't we all shouting about taking over Australia these days? Do we feel guilty? We'd say it's Australia that's constantly tripping us up. Japan attacked China, too, but to a far greater degree. I attacked China because I had no other choice. Everyone is just trying to justify themselves, and playing with moral blackmail is like the pot calling the kettle black. Of course, it depends on the person; different people have different perspectives. I can say it's the pot calling the kettle black, but I can also say that it's a case of analyzing each situation individually. Only those who can articulate the outcome can truly convince the public.

Honestly, it’s just how the media steers people. Our media keeps hammering that Japan invaded China and makes them out to be our “biggest enemy,” while totally ignoring what the Soviets did to us. Basically, they only teach us to hate Japan. And Japan? Same deal — most ordinary folks there never really learn about Japan’s invasion of China, so it’s no wonder they’re clueless. Kinda like asking most Chinese people about Tsarist Russia or the USSR — most of them wouldn’t know either.

不是，怎么大家对于小日子的态度那么惊讶吗？说实话，这真就是人的正常反应。
这就像两个人打架，一个把另一个打挺惨
被打的跟自己孩子说自己被打了，但是拼死把人赶出去了，没让人家把自己家占了
打人的那个回家也跟自己孩子说，本来那个人的家可以是咱家的，结果踏马的一个人高马大的来插手，把我们给打了，亏大了 。
然后一天被打的孩子遇到了打人的孩子，问人家当年你爹把我爹打了，你不对我们愧疚吗？
你期待人家回答什么？人家又能回答什么？
非要贴脸去问人家干嘛，你该怎么讨厌怎么讨厌就完了
人家跟我们虚与委蛇我们也可以维护表面和气

Honestly, I don’t get why everyone’s so surprised about how the Japanese act. This is just human nature.

It’s like two guys fight: one gets beaten pretty badly but manages to defend his home. He tells his kid, “Yeah, we got hit, but we didn’t lose our house.” The guy who did the hitting goes home and tells his kid, “That place could’ve been ours, but that guy stepped in and screwed us over.”

Now imagine the beaten kid meets the hitter’s kid and asks, “Hey, wasn’t it wrong what your dad did to mine?” What do you expect them to say? What can they even say?

Stop sticking your face into it. Hate however you feel, maintain appearances if you need to, and when the time comes to act—act decisively. Don’t expect anyone in power to empathize. With Japanese people, with elites—same thing.

What do ordinary Japanese people have to do with this? They go to school, go to work, just like us. And then suddenly some foreigner comes up and says, “Your great-grandfather’s neighbor’s cousin’s brother did some awful things, so you should feel guilty to me.”

That kind of crude, dumb attempt to seize the moral high ground—dressed up as patriotism—is just like playing a “sacrificial pawn” in Werewolf. It’s deliberately packaging Chinese people in a way that’s obnoxious, all under the banner of “love your country.”

Most people in China don’t even know about the counter‑attack against Vietnam. Even if they do, to us it was just teaching a disobedient junior a lesson.

> Honestly, hatred between nations isn’t something you can lecture away. You can talk about history, morality, or justice all you want, but people don’t forgive what they fear or what still affects their lives. If I were to try to ease hatred, I’d start by being brutally realistic: the past can’t be erased, but you can control the present. Hatred fades when it stops being useful, when it costs more than it benefits, or when survival demands it.
>
> First, I’d focus on self-interest. Ordinary people care about daily life: work, family, safety. Governments and media can feed anger, but citizens respond to what actually impacts them. Trade, joint projects, cultural exchanges—make peace profitable. Let them meet, talk, laugh, struggle together. Real understanding isn’t taught in classrooms or news broadcasts; it’s lived. Once people see the other side isn’t a threat, hatred loses its grip.
>
> Second, separate the state from the people. Blaming ordinary citizens for their ancestors’ crimes is absurd. My grandfather didn’t kill anyone, your grandfather didn’t either. Governments and elites can be responsible, institutions can be punished, but the average person is mostly just surviving. Hatred survives when you force generations to carry burdens they didn’t create. Let accountability hit where it belongs: leaders, institutions, warmongers—not children and workers.
>
> Finally, recognize reality without sentimentalizing it. Acknowledge atrocities happened, but don’t use them to shame or control the next generation. Hatred thrives when people feel compelled to “pay debts” for sins they didn’t commit. It weakens when they see cooperation, coexistence, and shared interest bring more strength, security, and dignity than endless resentment.
>
> In the end, hatred isn’t erased by words or ceremonies—it dies when practical reality, survival, and shared benefit outweigh fear and anger. That’s how I’d approach it: not with preaching or guilt, but with cold, unflinching clarity about what actually matters.
