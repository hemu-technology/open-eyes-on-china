商业团队里总会有利益之争，不像政治团队有一个终极目标，群殴的可能性几乎为零，而商业团队始终都会有挖墙脚抢生意的现象发生

In a business team, there are always conflicts of interest. Unlike a political team, which has a single ultimate goal and where brawls are almost nonexistent, business teams constantly face situations of poaching clients and undercutting each other.

That’s not the main point. The key is that the U.S. openly made little Japan “eat dirt,” like with the Hiroshima agreement, to keep Japan from running wild—the 40 years of stagnation started from then…
