![Sanae Takaichi elected as Japan’s Prime Minister.](images/2025/Sanae.jpeg (Sanae Takaichi))
On October 21, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader Sanae Takaichi was elected Japan’s 104th Prime Minister in the first round of the House of Representatives prime ministerial vote. Takaichi secured a majority of the votes, marking a historic moment as the first woman to hold the office in Japan.

Her election has drawn attention both domestically and internationally, with observers noting the significance of a female leader in a political landscape long dominated by men. While her victory represents a breakthrough for gender representation, Takaichi’s conservative political stance is expected to shape Japan’s policies on domestic and international issues in the coming years.

高市早苗成功当选日本首相并不令人意外，毕竟日本自民党已经统治了日本70年，中间很少失手，作为日本第一个女首相代表着民主的进步，但也面临着更大的挑战，所以能走多远还不好说。作为一个右翼政客，她是偏保守的，所以在外交上跟我国不会有好的发展，能维持现状就很难得了。

Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s Prime Minister comes as no surprise. After all, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has dominated Japanese politics for nearly seven decades, rarely losing power. Her rise as the country’s first female leader symbolizes a step forward for democracy, but it also brings greater challenges ahead. How far she can go remains to be seen.

As a right-leaning conservative politician, Takaichi is unlikely to bring any significant improvement in Japan’s relations with China. Maintaining the current status quo would already be considered an achievement.

Few people expect Sanae Takaichi to improve Japan–China relations; simply minimizing further damage would already be a positive outcome. Expecting her to take a conciliatory approach is like expecting a wolf to stop being a predator after becoming king of the forest.

That said, even the fiercest predator knows which animals to avoid. The strong tend to respect the strong — meaning that Japan’s tougher rhetoric may not necessarily translate into direct confrontation with major powers, but it could have consequences for weaker or smaller players in the region.

高市多少是麻生的半傀儡吧，并且也给自民搞出不少麻烦，要面对两个问题，自民党内关西议员和反对高市-麻生的以及和维新合作比较松散与选区矛盾。在没有公明的情况下拉拢维新阁外协作势必要分更多自己关西选区的利益给维新，这会影响自民党内关西选区议员的利益，且公明组织票没了后也可能影响小选区部分议员的利益，同时阁外协作与维新和自民选民结构重合更多，最后容易互相抢选票，不是关西继续变成维新的，就是自民吞并了维新，不像公明和自民选民结构重合不大还能互补，公明组织票支持自民，并且黑金问题也算个没解决的负面问题，所以维新能支持的可能只有首相指名与预算案，之后随时可能退出，比如大阪副首都达不成，所以估计大概率也是短期政府，有不低可能半年左右，一年就算成功
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Many political observers believe that Sanae Takaichi may be partially influenced by former Prime Minister Taro Aso and that her leadership could bring internal challenges to the LDP. She faces at least two major issues: factional disputes within the party — particularly among Kansai-based legislators and opponents of the Takaichi–Aso faction — and relatively loose collaboration with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin).

Without the support of Komeito, forming coalitions with Ishin requires conceding more interests from Kansai constituencies. This could negatively impact LDP legislators in Kansai districts. Additionally, losing Komeito’s organized vote may affect some small-district lawmakers’ prospects.

Since there is overlap between the voter bases of Ishin and the LDP in Kansai, coalition cooperation could lead to competition for votes. The result might be that either Ishin strengthens its position in Kansai or the LDP absorbs Ishin’s influence. This is different from the LDP–Komeito relationship, where voter bases overlap less and complement each other.

Moreover, unresolved issues such as “black money” scandals could further complicate governance. As a result, Ishin’s support may be limited to key measures like prime ministerial appointments and budget approval, and they could withdraw at any time — for example, if Osaka’s vice-capital plan fails. This suggests a high likelihood of a short-term government, potentially lasting around six months, with one year being the upper bound even if it succeeds.

Even if Takaichi assumes office, she lacks a majority in both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, making it nearly impossible to pass any major legislation.

However, securing this title may require conceding significant interests to the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin).

Japan’s challenges cannot be solved by a single leader alone.
Measures like aggressive fiscal policy or a weaker yen are unlikely to change the broader situation.

Even with far-right and populist factions in power, immigration policy in Japan may shift slightly toward the center or left.
This is due to internal party constraints, particularly from Kansai constituency lawmakers whose interests could be affected, as well as opposition within the party.
The Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), as an external coalition partner, also limits overly aggressive moves.

While immigration regulations are likely to tighten, these measures cannot resolve Japan’s reliance on foreign labor or its demographic challenges.
With a rapidly aging population and low birth rate, Japan faces structural constraints that prevent drastic changes.

我认为高市干不久。我不是怕日本搞事，相反我特别想看日本搞事，正好我们可以新仇旧恨一起算。但我认为高市达不到这个程度，就只是互联网时代靠喊麦放狠话打拳上位的首相，和微博小红书那些独立自主的女性博主一样，一看帖子惊天动地，一看点赞评999+，一开全女饭店书店酒吧一开一个倒，成不了事，最多就天天打卡神厕恶心一下你。

日本的经济不会因为换了高市上去就能扭转乾坤，日本的特殊繁荣年代已经是过去时了，即使把岛上的中国人都给赶走也没用，不过换印度人的话也许可以踩加速加快实现中日人均GDP同步。

日本想要获得经济增长，他们只能通过对外掠夺，他们就不具备把蛋糕做大的头脑，连个核污水都解决不了，还想着能解决什么？日本要是真牛逼，清洁能源发电应该是日本坐世界头把交椅，这样才体现出日本人居安思危，结果并没有，现在连汽车都准备给我国超了。

不排除高市在任期间会出现“排华”事件，如果有的话，估计会针对归化中国人，这个没有阻力的话，才有下一步，但是引发公众舆论危机的话，就会卡在这一步，换下一任。真要出现高市带着日本人搞大事的场景，那高市还得先对日本内部进行大清洗，把不主张武斗的那些给埋了，达成事实上的独裁才行。

I don't think Kaoshi will last long. I'm not afraid of Japan stirring up trouble; on the contrary, I'd really like to see it happen. It's a perfect opportunity for us to settle old scores and new ones. But I don't think Kaoshi can reach that level. She's just another internet-age prime minister who rose to power by shouting, lashing out, and fighting, like those independent female bloggers on Weibo and Xiaohongshu. Their posts are earth-shattering, their likes and comments accrue 999+, and their all-female restaurants, bookstores, and bars all fail. They're nothing short of a disaster. At best, they'll just be annoying you by checking in at the "Holy Toilets" every day.

Japan's economy won't be turned around just by Kaoshi. Japan's unique era of prosperity is over. Even driving all the Chinese off the islands wouldn't help. However, replacing them with Indians might accelerate the process of achieving per capita GDP parity between China and Japan.

Japan can only achieve economic growth through external plunder. They don't have the acumen to expand their pie. They can't even solve the problem of nuclear wastewater, so what else do they expect to solve? If Japan were truly powerful, it would be the world leader in clean energy generation, demonstrating the Japanese's commitment to preparedness. However, this hasn't happened. Now, even my country is poised to surpass them in automobile production.

It's possible that there will be anti-Chinese sentiment during Kaohsiung's tenure. If so, it's likely to target naturalized Chinese. If this doesn't prove resistant, the next step will be taken. However, if it triggers a public opinion crisis, the situation will be stalled at this stage and the next administration will be replaced. If Kaohsiung truly intends to lead the Japanese into a major uprising, he'll first have to conduct a major purge within Japan, burying those who don't advocate armed conflict and establishing a de facto dictatorship.

高市是自民党内著名的经济专家和行政专家。以鼓吹减税刺激消费、积极财政政策而著名。

她没有什么外交经验，也基本没有军事经验。

高市在国家观、家庭观等等，属于保守右翼。她被视为安倍的政治继承人。

由于左倾的公明党退出执政联盟，而右翼的“维新会”加入执政联盟。意味着90年代以来日本政治“左右联合执政”的局面宣告终结。

高市政权是一个比较单纯的右倾政权。90年代以来，日本还是第一次出现这样的单纯右翼政权。以前总是左右混合政权。

如果高市能够长期稳定执政的话，有很大概率会推进日本宪法的修改。

Sanae Takaichi is known within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as an expert in economics and administration, particularly advocating for tax cuts to stimulate consumption and proactive fiscal policies.
She has limited diplomatic and military experience.

Takaichi’s views on national and family issues are conservative and right-leaning, and she is widely regarded as a political heir to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

With the left-leaning Komeito party exiting the governing coalition and the right-wing Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) joining, Japan’s long-standing “left–right coalition” arrangement since the 1990s has effectively ended.
Takaichi’s administration represents a purely right-leaning government — the first of its kind in Japan since the 1990s, when coalition governments typically blended left and right factions.

If Takaichi can maintain stable, long-term governance, there is a significant likelihood that she will pursue amendments to Japan’s constitution.

</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Within the LDP, Takaichi lacks overwhelming authority and largely depends on support from former Deputy Prime Minister Aso.
With the Komeito party exiting the coalition, she must rely on the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) to maintain a governing majority, which could undermine the interests of Kansai and small-district LDP lawmakers.

Ishin, as an external coalition partner, retains the flexibility to withdraw support or apply pressure as it sees fit.
Its voter base overlaps more with the LDP than Komeito’s religiously organized supporters, who historically provide more stable backing.

Taken together, these factors suggest that Takaichi’s administration is likely to be short-lived.

It’s likely that Takaichi will mostly make bold statements without taking drastic actions, given Japan’s demographic challenges.
Low birth rates and an aging population make recruitment for the Self-Defense Forces difficult, while anti-foreign labor and immigration policies are hard to enforce in practice.

Her immediate challenges as Prime Minister will be domestic: forming a stable cabinet amid the possibility of Komeito withdrawing from the coalition and the risk of opposition parties attempting to topple her government.

First, if the Self-Defense Forces are understaffed, they could follow Ukraine's lead and hire American soldiers as conscripts to draft them.

(Note: Don't argue that aging nations can't fight wars.

我记得好像说她继承的是安倍的政治遗志，还是经济上靠中国，安全上靠美国呗。这套打法在2010年到2016年这段时间很好用，但是现在估计很难实施。

因为现在中美的竞争已经到了明面上了，10年前你说要中美竞争，不光其他国家，我们国内很多人自己都会笑的。但现在不一样，现在已经到了要站队的时候了，在实施这种骑墙的政策，可能招致经济和安全的双重问题。

不过路径依赖嘛，能理解，招不在新，有用就行，中间出现的种种问题，肯定不能像在竞选的时候以极端保守做法，那无异自掘坟墓。
你知道的，我最喜欢看的就是候选人竞选成功后，如何应付当初的承诺。

I recall that she is often described as inheriting Abe’s political legacy — economically leaning on China while relying on the United States for security. That formula worked fairly well between 2010 and 2016, but it will be much harder to implement today.

The U.S.–China competition is now out in the open. Ten years ago, talking about a U.S.–China rivalry would have drawn laughs at home and abroad; today, the pressure to choose sides is real. Trying to pursue a fence‑sitting policy now risks creating both economic and security problems.

Still, path dependence matters — political playbooks aren’t reinvented if the old ones work. But any attempt to govern by the same extreme rhetoric used during the campaign would be self‑defeating. What I enjoy watching most is how candidates handle the promises they made on the campaign trail once they actually take power.

> Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s Prime Minister carries significant symbolic weight for both Japan and the wider Asian political landscape. As the first female Prime Minister in Japan’s constitutional history, her rise marks progress in gender representation. However, it’s important to note that her policies and political stance have little to do with feminism or women’s rights. She firmly occupies the conservative-right spectrum, supporting married couples keeping the same surname, opposing a female emperor, and advocating traditional family values — a classic example of a right-wing political heir, with backing from Aso.
> 
> Economically, Takaichi’s focus is on tax cuts and an active fiscal policy, continuing the Abe-era economic approach. She aims to push domestic reform, particularly in addressing Japan’s aging population and declining birth rates. Yet her challenges extend beyond the economy. She must navigate complex domestic politics, including coalition formation, potential withdrawal of Komeito, and opposition party threats. The inclusion of the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) in her coalition strengthens her right-leaning agenda but also forces her to balance party and local constituency interests, making long-term governance a delicate task.
> 
> On foreign and security policy, there is unlikely to be a fundamental shift regardless of her election. While she has called for asserting control over disputed territories such as the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, the Northern Territories, and Dokdo/Takeshima, these statements are largely campaign rhetoric. In reality, Japan faces demographic challenges and the pressures of U.S.–China competition, making any aggressive foreign or military action highly impractical. The stability of China–Japan relations will depend more on pragmatic policies and mutual interests than on individual political will.
> 
> In sum, Takaichi’s election solidifies the Japanese right-wing presence, but her policy priorities remain largely economic. Her ability to stay in power long-term hinges on intra-party politics, economic performance, and societal support. Symbolically, she represents a milestone for women in leadership, but her substantive impact on gender equality is limited. For China, maintaining a steady, normalized relationship with Japan remains the most realistic and prudent strategy.
