  <strong class="translated-label">Translator’s Commentary:</strong><br>
Reading through all the comments in this article, I’d like to offer some reflections from my own perspective. The discussion ranges from international relations, geopolitics, and economic competition, to social phenomena such as protests and gender dynamics.

From my viewpoint:

Many observations about South Korea’s anti-China protests highlight the role of perceived national weakness and economic anxiety, but it’s important to remember that public protests exist in all societies for multiple reasons, not just strength or weakness.

The discussions about gender dynamics, female choice, and evolutionary psychology are provocative, but they reflect general tendencies rather than absolute rules. Real-world social behaviors are far more complex and influenced by culture, institutions, and policy.

Comments connecting geopolitical competition, economic shifts, and social behaviors illustrate a lens of strategic analysis, but one should be cautious about conflating individual behavior with national-level strategy.

Overall, the article provides insight into a particular set of online perceptions in China, showing how readers interpret foreign relations and domestic society through historical, economic, and even biological analogies.

In short, from my perspective, the piece is as much a reflection of the commenters’ worldview as it is a discussion of actual events.

➡️ **Welcome to leave your own opinions, so that more Chinese readers can see different perspectives, alternative viewpoints, and diverse political stances.**

其实是好事，后续会带来很多人意想不到的好处。

游行抗议是弱者对强者的一种集中力量展示。

所以我们只见过人民对强者抗议，没见过人民对弱者进行抗议。

比如日本人游行抗议美国、韩国人游行抗议中国、全世界老百姓游行抗议本国政府等等。

你能想象中国人游行抗议菲律宾入侵南海、以色列人游行抗议哈马斯特别行动、美国人游行抗议墨西哥帮派输入毒品吗？

用不着，直接A上去就完了。

韩国人抗议中国本质上是他们危机感的集中爆发。

论人均资源储量、论耕地面积、论人均粮食产出，韩国人比朝鲜还差得多。

生活在粮食自给率只有20%的国家，韩国人心里很清楚，一旦产业被打爆，迎接他们的将不只是生活困难而已，而是实打实的生存危机。

人面对重大危机后心理六个阶段：震惊、否认、愤怒、磋商、抑郁、接受。

这是典型愤怒期的表现。

这说明他们已经渡过否认期，开始接受中国实力远超于他们的现实。

我们冷眼旁观就是，自然会结束的，接下来就是磋商期了。

此时，韩国人会开始在一些重大利益方面做出让步以换取苟活的希望。

所以我才说后续会有一些现在看不到的好处出现。

立帖为证，算命的骗你十年八年，我这里用不了一年半载就可以看到结果。

This might not be a bad thing at all. In fact, it could bring unexpected benefits in the future.

Protests are essentially a way for the weak to collectively demonstrate against the strong. That’s why we often see people protesting against stronger powers—for example, Japanese people protesting the U.S., South Koreans protesting China, or citizens protesting their own governments. But you rarely see protests against weaker parties. Can you imagine Chinese people protesting the Philippines over the South China Sea? Israelis protesting Hamas raids? Americans protesting Mexican cartels? Of course not. When facing a weaker opponent, there’s no need to protest—you simply confront them directly.

South Koreans protesting China reflects a concentrated outburst of their growing sense of crisis. With a food self-sufficiency rate of only 20%, South Korea’s per capita resource reserves and arable land are even worse than North Korea’s. South Koreans know very well that if their industrial base collapses, what awaits them isn’t just economic hardship, but a real survival crisis.

When people face existential threats, they typically go through six psychological stages: shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. South Korea is clearly in the “anger stage.” This means they’ve already moved past denial and are beginning to accept the reality that China’s strength far surpasses theirs.

So all we need to do is watch calmly. When they enter the “bargaining stage,” South Korea will inevitably make concessions on major interests in order to secure survival.

That’s why I believe this wave of protests could eventually bring unexpected advantages. Mark my words—it won’t take a decade, just a year or two for the outcome to become clear.

我和你的看法一致，同时游行反华，就说明内部有亲华势力，游行越激烈就说明那股势力越强，打个比方，就不会有人游行呼吁禁止吃狗屎，因为大家都不会这么做，但是如果真的看到有人游行呼吁禁止吃狗屎，那就说明当地吃狗屎是一种大面积的现象。 这阵反华趋势一过，他们就认命了。

I completely agree with your perspective. In fact, the very existence of anti-China protests suggests that there is a significant pro-China force within South Korea. The more intense the protests become, the stronger that underlying force usually is.

Think of it this way: no one would ever protest to “ban eating excrement,” because it’s not something people normally do. But if you actually see people protesting with signs demanding a ban, it only means that eating excrement must be widespread enough to be a real issue.

By the same logic, today’s anti-China protests in South Korea actually indicate that China’s influence has already taken root in their society. Once this wave of emotion passes, they’ll eventually have no choice but to accept reality.

他其实少说了一种情况，就是你所在的国家、群体切实被伤害了，但是对方是一个组织或者国家，你作为普通民众不能直接动手报复，那么通过游行呼吁政府来出手也是一种可行的行为。这可以参考911之后的美国游行。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
He actually left out one situation: when your country or community has indeed been harmed, but the other side is an organization or another country. As an ordinary citizen, you can’t directly retaliate, so organizing protests to urge your government to take action becomes a feasible approach. A good example would be the protests in the U.S. after 9/11.

说的正确，前几年的港乱也是这个道理，现在放下面子往深圳跑，接受了现实。30/35年这个效应会出现在欧美，到时候华人要注意安全了。40/45年欧美会接受现实。

道理也简单，嫉妒会发生在一个层次的，当超越了这个层次就没有人嫉妒了。像普通物理教师不会嫉妒钱学森，开手机店的不会嫉妒任正非。

<div class="translated-text">
That’s absolutely correct. The chaos in Hong Kong a few years back followed the same logic. Now they’ve dropped the pretense and head south to Shenzhen, accepting reality. Around 2030/2035 this same effect will appear in Europe and the U.S., and by then Chinese people abroad should be mindful of their safety. By 2040/2045, the West will also come to terms with reality.

The reasoning is simple: jealousy only occurs between peers. Once you’ve gone far beyond someone’s level, jealousy fades away. A regular physics teacher won’t be jealous of Qian Xuesen, and a small phone shop owner won’t be jealous of Ren Zhengfei.

Did they really lose anything by going to Shenzhen?

一年半载有点儿快了。。这个时间取决于美国的经济形式，因为韩国经济是嵌入到美国体系之中，甚至韩国的存在都是靠美国。。如果美国的衰退能拉长到四五十年，韩国可以通过减少出生率实现软着陆，，如果美国三五年内爆发经济危机，甚至吸血韩国，那韩国将面临巨大危机，毕竟失去大国经济体系的扶持，单靠韩国自己能养活的人口可以参考朝鲜。。。这里有个重要的时间点就是东南那个岛，那个岛一动整个西方体系都有崩盘风险。。[吃瓜]

ChatGPT 说：

A year or so might be a bit too fast… The timing really depends on the state of the U.S. economy, because South Korea’s economy is embedded within the American system—its very existence even relies on the U.S.

If a U.S. downturn stretches over 40–50 years, South Korea could achieve a soft landing by reducing its birth rate. But if the U.S. faces an economic crisis in the next three to five years, or even “sucks resources” from Korea, then South Korea would face a huge crisis. Without the backing of a major economic power, the population that South Korea can support on its own would be comparable to North Korea.

An important tipping point here is that island in the Southeast: if it moves, the entire Western system could risk collapse. 🍿

Agreed! Protests are essentially impotent rage—they look loud and impressive, but in reality, they’re useless. From my perspective, the main purpose of this South Korean protest is actually to send a message to the U.S.: “If you don’t act, we’re done for!”

So there’s really no need to focus on what South Korea does; just watch what the U.S. does!

China’s development will be like climate change—just by living normal lives and working steadily, it can dismantle the colonial system that the white pirate powers built over hundreds of years.

In the future, there will only be one global industrial and division-of-labor system, led by China. Every country will need to reposition itself and find the industries where it can integrate into this system. Those who resist will suffer badly; if you don’t claim a spot, someone else will rush in to fill it.

韩国人的信息收集能力是日本人级别的（可以归结为民族性）。 对华利益相关者们对中国的各方面调查非常详尽。 经常有让我耳目一新的见解。 民众再反华，政商两界也反不了。 朝鲜在中国旁边存续了几千年，有存在的道理的。

South Koreans’ information-gathering ability is on par with the Japanese (which can be attributed to national traits). Stakeholders with interests related to China conduct very detailed investigations into all aspects of China, often providing insights that are refreshing and eye-opening. Even if the public turns anti-China, the political and business circles cannot ignore realities. North Korea has existed next to China for thousands of years, and its continued existence has its reasons.

Today, Japan and South Korea have already lost their bargaining power. Back in 2018, or even 2020, they still had considerable leverage.

Now, though, as Lao Zhong has noticed, China can accomplish this task even without Japan and South Korea.

你呀短短一段话有很多错误

抗议和强弱没关系，比如外边有抗议中国吃狗肉猫肉的，再比如美国有抗议不够支持以色列的，再比如欧洲有伊斯兰支持者抗议和反伊斯兰抗议的，太多例子，抗议根本和强弱无必然联系

另外，有的国家抗议不了

而且，你说菲律宾这种不用抗议，上去就干更是笑掉大牙，菲律宾破船在南海这么多年了，啥时候干了?

Protests are not necessarily tied to strength or weakness. For example:

In some countries, people protest against China for eating dog or cat meat.

In the United States, citizens protest when the government is perceived as not supporting Israel enough.

In Europe, there are both pro-Islam and anti-Islam protests.

These examples show that protests can occur regardless of a country’s or group’s power; they are often expressions of interests, cultural positions, or emotions.

Additionally, some countries cannot protest due to authoritarian or high-pressure environments, even if there is widespread dissatisfaction.

Finally, the idea that one can “just act” without protest is also unrealistic. Take the Philippines and the South China Sea as an example: despite years of disputes, there has been no decisive military action, showing that even if a country wants to act, practical constraints—military capability, international pressure, and other factors—limit what can actually be done.

In summary, protests are simply one way for people to express their opinions and do not inherently reflect the strength or weakness of a nation or group.

The first time I joined a protest was after the U.S. bombed our embassy in Yugoslavia. That was genuinely frustrating.

没有，要听实话吗？目前中国体现了两大垄断特征：金融垄断、官僚垄断。就算韩国被吃干抹净，好处也落不到老百姓头上。而且，中国没有专门的资本利得税，也没有直接税，更没有除籍税，利得阶层几乎横行无忌，比如35岁淘汰制公然成了很多公司的惯例。



所以目前国内有类似美国的特征，即舆论界奇谈怪论层出不穷，民间内部撕裂，底层互害严重，这都是怕老百姓联合起来，有人刻意煽动。想想杨笠、傅首尔这些人，明明是臭大街的货色，却商单不断。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
No, you want the unvarnished truth? Currently, China exhibits two major monopolistic characteristics: financial monopoly and bureaucratic monopoly. Even if Korea were completely dominated, the benefits wouldn’t trickle down to ordinary people. Moreover, China lacks a dedicated capital gains tax, has no comprehensive direct taxes, and certainly no estate tax. The elite operate almost unchecked; for example, the “35-year cutoff” rule has openly become standard practice in many companies.

Domestically, China shows traits similar to the U.S.: strange and extreme opinions flourish in public discourse, internal divisions among the populace are severe, and the lower strata harm each other—largely because there’s fear of ordinary people uniting, and some actively stir up conflict. Think of figures like Yang Li or Fu Seoul: clearly low-quality personalities, yet they keep getting commercial opportunities.

Yes. I used to dislike Korea, but when they started protesting and demonstrating, I didn’t feel as much dislike—rather, I felt a bit sad. You see, when a country becomes strong, its neighbors are never truly happy about it. The same goes for individuals. So, we should just focus on living our own lives. Increasingly, we don’t need the emotional boost from foreign admiration, nor do we need the recognition of the international community. Praise either carries interest or sympathy; without either, it’s just hollow flattery.

The truly funny thing about the anti-China protests in South Korea is that there are more Korean women than men in the crowds.

Because Korean men actually have to serve in the military and go to the battlefield.

Korean women, however, are in a different position: if there’s a victory, it’s foreign men who die; if there’s a loss, it’s their own men who die. Either way, they’re guaranteed to “win.”

The reason China hasn’t seen a strong pushback against radical feminism like in Japan or South Korea is that a portion of Chinese men still indulge women, which prevents an effective containment of radical feminists’ arrogance.

Honestly, why the intense competition (“involution”)? Too many workers.
Why don’t people have kids? They simply don’t want to.
If you forbid women from going to school or working, not only would the birth rate stop declining, but wages would also rise.

这才是正解，阿富汗只有不到一半的人能工作，塔利班把女性赶回家庭，使得阿富汗男人工作机会更多了，另外生育率也上来了，20年的发展足够现在生下来多出来的男孩长大后也能大部分有工作，所以塔利班的做法非常对，既避免了内卷，又提高了生育率还让20年后无忧，并且20年后大部分国家都缺人，他们反而能把多出来的人口输出出去。反正我认为塔利班是能存在最久的组织，而某些个组织，别看有十几亿人，二百年后就得完蛋，不到400年直接灭绝。

<div class="translated-text">
This is the correct reasoning. In Afghanistan, less than half the population can work. By sending women back to the home, the Taliban increased employment opportunities for men. At the same time, the birth rate rose. Over 20 years, enough boys would grow up to mostly have jobs. Thus, the Taliban’s approach avoids overcompetition, boosts fertility, and ensures long-term workforce stability. Twenty years from now, as many countries face population shortages, Afghanistan could even export surplus labor. In my view, the Taliban is one of the longest-surviving organizations, whereas some groups—despite having billions of people—might face extinction within 200 years, and certainly within 400.

如果你去仔细看看视频，会发现游行的很多都是女性，要求对抗中朝，在正常国家这种战争游行女性参与度都是很低的。但是在韩国性别对抗过于激烈，这些韩女根本不在乎后果是啥，能把男性杀掉就好了。说起来也奇怪，世界各地的女拳都没有国家情节，普遍外男＞国男，我至今对此很为不解。

If you take a closer look at the videos, you’ll notice that many of the protesters are women, demanding opposition to China and North Korea. In normal countries, female participation in war-related protests is usually very low. But in South Korea, gender antagonism is so intense that these women don’t care about the consequences—they just want men to suffer. Strangely, feminist movements around the world rarely show such nationalistic tendencies; generally, foreign men > domestic men in their focus, which I still find puzzling.

这有什么不好理解的，女权要的是权力，在本国的权力，所以本国男性是她们的竞争对手，外国男性是潜在帮手，把两性对立看作两个组织对立，比如国共，民主党和共和党对立就明白了。

It’s not hard to understand. Feminism seeks power—power within their own country—so domestic men are their competitors, while foreign men are potential allies. Think of the gender conflict as a conflict between two organizations, like the rivalry between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, or between Democrats and Republicans.

基因决定的，我记着有个什么人物，说女性很少去选择爱情，而是被动接受爱情。从毳毛失血中演化到如今的女性，必然是慕强的，因为生存和繁衍是刻在基因里的传承，不能让女性生存，繁衍不了养活不了后代，女性就放弃你，你也不配拥有这些。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
It’s determined by genetics. I recall someone saying that women rarely actively choose love; rather, they passively accept it. Evolving from the days of losing body hair and blood, modern women are naturally attracted to strength, because survival and reproduction are hardwired into their genes. If a woman cannot survive, reproduce, and provide for her offspring, she will abandon you—you simply do not deserve to have her.

实际上是女人的这种慕强被别人找到了漏洞，钻了空子，渣男从来不用养活女性和她的孩子，也不需要保证女人的生存，但依然可以获得大量的女性。说白了，有一部分男人找到了女人择偶的漏洞，发现其实我并不需要真的强，只要能短期之内让女人认为我很强，发生关系之后就跑路，同样可以得到大量后代，这就是为什么女人会选择那些提上裤子就跑的黄

<div class="translated-text">
In reality, this natural attraction to strength in women has a loophole that some men have exploited. “Bad boys” don’t need to support the woman or her children, nor ensure her survival, yet they can still attract many women. Simply put, some men discovered a flaw in women’s mate selection: they realized they don’t actually need to be genuinely strong—if they can make a woman perceive them as strong in the short term, then leave after the encounter, they can still father many offspring. This is why some women end up choosing those reckless “run-and-hide” guys.

你实际上说到点子上了，如果全社会都对渣男有一个低的道德评价，从而影响到了渣男的社会生活和发展，让渣男晚景凄凉，那么自然能减少这种男人。但是问题是现在这种道德制约失灵了，渣男根本得不到惩罚，他们可以到处浪完然后隐瞒过去找个老实女接盘，就算被发现了离婚他们也不亏，包括渣女也是一样，过去女人当🐔要被歧视，现在她们完全也可以洗白上岸找个老实男人接盘。这就是欧美这套进步主义搞出来的问题，本来渣男渣女这种人是应该被社会唾弃的，但是现在他们可以打拳，可以攻击你是性压抑，思想落后，不尊重少数群体，这导致社会根本制裁不了他们，于是婚恋市场就陷入恐慌。

<div class="translated-text">
You actually hit the nail on the head. If society as a whole morally condemned “jerks,” affecting their social life and career and making their later years miserable, the number of such men would naturally decrease. But the problem today is that these moral constraints have largely failed: jerks go unpunished. They can sleep around, hide their past, and find an honest woman to take over. Even if exposed through divorce, they don’t really suffer. The same goes for “jerk women.” In the past, women who behaved like this were stigmatized, but now they can easily rehabilitate themselves and find an honest man to take over.

This is the problem created by Western-style progressivism. People who should be shunned by society—jerks and scoundrels—are no longer effectively condemned. Instead, they can fight back, claiming you are sexually repressed, backward-thinking, or intolerant of minority groups. As a result, society can no longer sanction them, and the dating and marriage market falls into panic.

你要记住，女性基因的扩散跟“民族国家”是冲突的。

举个例子：原始社会部落冲突后，被击败的部落里，男性被杀，女性被俘虏后成为“生育工具”，但女性的X会被传播开来，而获胜部落里的女性则会面临配偶被共享、甚至潜在配偶被抢夺的风险，导致自己的X无法传播。因此，原始社会里，女性没有部落情怀，她们甚至会希望自己的部落被打败，让自己和自己的女儿、孙女被不同的部落掳走交配。

你把原始社会的部落一词，换成现代社会的国家一词，同样成立。如果中国被打败，那么中国女人会被韩国、越南、菲律宾等国家瓜分，中国女人的X就可以挣脱束缚，在全球扩散，反之，如果中国成了世界第一，中国男人娶外国女人的几率会年年拔高，届时中国本土女人不仅结婚率暴跌，而且面临全球女性的竞争，如果你是中国女人，你会不会成为汉奸？你会不会带领外族剿灭华夏复兴？这件事放在韩国身上也是成立的，韩女打压韩男，媚外是基因的作用，全球女性皆如此，就看前二十年接受教育里有没有压制这一属性，如果没压住，那绝对会媚外。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
You have to remember that the spread of female genes can conflict with the concept of a “nation-state.”

For example, in primitive societies, after tribal conflicts, males of the defeated tribe were often killed, and females were captured and used as “reproductive tools.” The X chromosomes of these women would spread widely. Conversely, women in the victorious tribe faced risks such as shared mates or even having potential mates taken away, which limited the spread of their own X chromosomes. Therefore, in primitive societies, women had little tribal loyalty; they might even wish for their tribe to be defeated so that they and their daughters or granddaughters could be captured by different tribes for reproduction.

If you replace the term “tribe” with “modern nation,” the logic still holds. If China were defeated, Chinese women could be “divided” among countries like Korea, Vietnam, or the Philippines, allowing their X chromosomes to escape local constraints and spread globally. Conversely, if China became the world’s top power, Chinese men’s likelihood of marrying foreign women would increase year by year. In that scenario, domestic Chinese women would face declining marriage rates and global competition from women elsewhere. If you were a Chinese woman, would you become a traitor? Would you lead outsiders to suppress a Chinese revival?

The same logic applies to Korea. Korean women suppressing Korean men and showing affinity toward foreigners is a product of genetics. Globally, all women behave similarly—it’s just a question of whether the first twenty years of education successfully suppressed this tendency. If not, the inclination to favor outsiders will certainly manifest.

This is true… it’s the same in Europe. German women often disparage German men, saying that men over 30 are balding and pot-bellied. They also claim that every 9 seconds a woman in Germany experiences violence or sexual assault.

无论男女，都很难对抗基因带给我们的本能。
男人花心颜狗，女人虚荣媚外，都是有助于DNA延续的优势本能。要承认并正视，不要一味否认。

<div class="translated-text">
Regardless of gender, it’s very difficult to resist the instincts coded in our genes. Men’s flirtatiousness and attraction to physical beauty, and women’s vanity and preference for foreign partners, are all adaptive instincts that favor the continuation of DNA. We need to acknowledge and face them, rather than blindly deny them.

There’s nothing hard to understand here. Back in my elementary school days in the 1990s, I read a book analyzing the differences between men and women. It discussed factors behind female infidelity and specifically mentioned women’s genetic instinct to favor foreign men. This instinct is encoded in their genes and exists to maintain genetic diversity.

旅游时偶遇几个韩国人，自我感觉良好，但死活不肯信，中国其实根本没把韩国放在眼里……

他们比我们还关注中国人怎么看待韩国的问题。尤其是中日韩三国在贸易和国际地位上的竞争。

我说中国在乎的唯一一个竞争对手，只有美国，其他国家想怎么样竞争都无所谓，他破防了，开始飙韩国话。

这大叔挺有意思的，跟后来遇到的一位印度小哥是卧龙凤雏，一个说首尔比北京大，一个说孟买比上海贵。这俩人都没有来过中国……
</small>
</details>
<div class="translated-text">
While traveling, I ran into a few Koreans who were very self-satisfied but absolutely refused to believe that China didn’t even really care about South Korea…

They seemed more concerned about how Chinese people view South Korea than about China itself—especially in the context of trade and international status among China, Japan, and South Korea.

I told them the only competitor China actually cares about is the U.S.; for other countries, their competition doesn’t matter. That completely threw them off, and they started spouting Korean-centric arguments.

This older guy was quite interesting. Later I met a young Indian guy, and together they were like the Wolong and Fengchu of debating: one claimed Seoul is bigger than Beijing, the other said Mumbai is more expensive than Shanghai. Neither of them had actually been to China…

告诉他们一个事实就行：中国驻韩国大使是司局级，和驻东南亚、非洲国家的大使一个等级。相应的，中国驻朝鲜大使是副部级，驻美国、俄罗斯的是特命全权大使，是外交大使最高等级。这就是韩国在中国政府眼中的等级。
</small>
</details>
<div class="translated-text">
Just tell them one fact: the Chinese ambassador to South Korea is at the departmental level, the same as ambassadors to Southeast Asian or African countries. In contrast, the Chinese ambassador to North Korea is at the vice-ministerial level, while those to the U.S. or Russia are full-fledged ambassadors with plenipotentiary powers—the highest rank in diplomacy. This is exactly how the Chinese government ranks South Korea in its diplomatic hierarchy.

但是大部分国人都知道美国、俄罗斯、澳大利亚很大，这是看地图就能明白的事情。
反而是日本，很多人觉得小，但实际上从南到北的距离非常长，相当于江苏到广州雷州半岛（不含琉球诸岛），而如果拿日本跟中国各省排名，能位列第九位，仅次于云南。

<div class="translated-text">
But most people in China know that the U.S., Russia, and Australia are huge—it’s obvious just by looking at a map. Japan, on the other hand, is often thought of as small, but in reality, its north-to-south distance is very long—roughly equivalent to traveling from Jiangsu to the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong (excluding the Ryukyu Islands). If you compare Japan with Chinese provinces by area, it would rank ninth, just behind Yunnan.
