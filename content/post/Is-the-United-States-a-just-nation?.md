美国是个很有意思的国家
人人都可以买枪，却没人想着闹革命；媒体总是充斥坏消息，却没人想着移民；随时随地骂政府，对同胞对路人却热情友善；到处都有人聚众集会，却没人鸣冤叫屈向官员下拜；有最先进的军队和武器，却只是留着对外人用。

The United States is a very interesting country.

Everyone can buy guns, yet no one thinks about starting a revolution. The media is always filled with bad news, yet few think about emigrating. People criticize the government openly anytime and anywhere, yet they are warm and friendly toward fellow citizens and strangers. Crowds gather in demonstrations everywhere, yet no one kneels before officials to plead grievances. They have the most advanced military and weapons, yet they are reserved only for use against outsiders.

That’s the thing—the key advantage of democracy is how easy it is to shift the blame: after all, it was the people who voted them in. No matter how big the mess, it’s everyone’s fault—which means it’s really no one’s fault.

What about problems at home? Do you dare hold anyone accountable? Do you dare report on them? Haven’t enough issues already been blamed on capital and companies like Meituan? Back when Biden was in office, U.S. media outlets ran plenty of reports about his alleged misconduct and his son’s crimes. Even if they don’t shift the blame, do you have the power to hold them to account? And in all those audit reports over the years from the National Audit Office, has the embezzled public money ever really been recovered?

Did you know that someone actually bet on the election back then—and made hundreds of millions? Even the betting companies contacted him to stop him from placing more bets! When he hired a polling company, they asked respondents, “Who do you think your neighbors will vote for?” instead of “Who will you vote for?” By asking what others might do, respondents could speak freely without pressure. You people are really something! Always afraid that the people might get the rights that already belong to them!

马来西亚要是大军压境时不时挨炸，未必不会是极端绿崛起。美军兵败越南，红色越共也会专注经济发展，同样的北棒50年来每年被军事演习威慑两次，只能一门心思搓核弹。历史不能假设，互为因果。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
If Malaysia faced the constant threat of invasion or periodic bombings, the rise of extreme green movements wouldn’t be unlikely. When the U.S. was defeated in Vietnam, the Red Viet Cong could focus on economic development. Similarly, North Korea, being threatened twice a year by military exercises for the past 50 years, can only concentrate on developing nuclear weapons. History cannot be hypothesized; causes and effects are intertwined.

马来没影响吃猪肉，不过马来人政府限制了当地华裔与印度裔公办大学与公务考试的入取率，我一个马来西亚华裔朋友说，假设公办学校录取10人，8个是马来人，剩下两名额给华裔与印度裔，华裔要比马来人努力十倍才有希望上公立大学

华裔与印度裔人口比例不小，华裔曾经占人口44%，虽然华裔现在仅占马来西亚总人口的约22.6%，又受教育与政治结构性不公，但在商业领域（尤其是私营经济）的占比可能高达 60%-70%，仅就金融、能源等受政府管控的行业，马来裔商人比例才高，

马来西亚能有今天，最大可靠是华裔与印度裔，潜力被压抑，最大障碍就是穆斯林，一天礼拜五次，别本事没有，强调身份报团打压异类能力很强
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Malaysia’s pork consumption isn’t affected, but the government restricts the admission rates of local Chinese and Indian students in public universities and civil service exams. A Malaysian Chinese friend explained it like this: if a public university admits 10 students, 8 spots go to Malays, leaving only 2 for Chinese and Indians. Chinese students have to work ten times harder than Malays just to have a chance at getting into a public university.

The Chinese and Indian populations are not insignificant. The Chinese once made up 44% of the population; now they account for about 22.6% of Malaysia’s total population. Despite facing structural inequalities in education and politics, they dominate the business sector—especially the private economy—where their share could reach 60%-70%. In government-controlled industries like finance and energy, Malay entrepreneurs are more prevalent.

Malaysia’s success today owes much to the Chinese and Indian communities. Yet their potential is suppressed, and the biggest obstacle comes from the Muslim majority. Praying five times a day, they may lack other skills, but their emphasis on identity and group loyalty gives them a strong ability to suppress outsiders.

I haven’t been to the U.S., so I won’t make any rash judgments about whether it’s “good” or not. But looking at historical reports, in countries that follow the Americans’ lead, ordinary people tend to live comfortably. In countries that confront the U.S. head-on, the rulers aside, ordinary citizens often have barely enough to eat, with even basic rations controlled—let alone other consumer comforts. In that sense, the U.S. government does seem to be a relatively capable one.

I don’t know what they’re really thinking, but one thing’s clear—they dare not go against the Jews, and instead, a super “thought-crime” law got passed. In the 21st century, a quarter of the way through it, in the world’s strongest country, the idea that simply “thinking” could be a crime—who would have believed it before?

So you see, white people have always been all show and no substance. Back in the Middle Ages, when lower-class whites lived worse than dogs, their rebellions were few and weak. They were just sycophants to those above and bullies to those below.

我表述一下，你看是否属实：

1、有枪在手，却只打无辜的校园学生（校园枪击）

2、媒体总是宣扬公平竞争，却打压华为和TIKTOK

3、总是强调种族平等，却不能说犹太的坏话，歧视亚裔

4、强调法制，却允许零元购的存在

5、说是允许聚众集会，但是却驱赶支持巴勒斯坦的大学生，甚至威胁不让他们毕业

6、号称世界警察，维护和平，却挑起了伊拉克战争、利比亚战争、叙利亚战争等
</small>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Here’s a translation of your points, rendered in natural English while keeping your meaning intact:

1. They have guns in their hands, yet often use them against innocent school students (school shootings).
2. The media constantly promotes the idea of fair competition, yet suppresses companies like Huawei and TikTok.
3. They always emphasize racial equality, yet criticizing Jews is taboo and Asians face discrimination.
4. They claim to uphold the rule of law, yet allow scams like “zero-dollar purchases” to exist.
5. They say public assemblies are allowed, yet students supporting Palestine are driven away—or even threatened with graduation consequences.
6. They claim to be the world’s police, maintaining peace, yet they instigated wars in Iraq, Libya, Syria, and more.

If you want, I can also help you make this version slightly more concise and polished for an article or social media post while keeping your critical tone.

1、虽然禁枪，但是其他武器杀伤严重（珠海车辆35杀，江苏刀战无差别伤人，湖北枪击案）

2、媒体总是宣扬四海清平，却打压敢说实话的媒体，宣扬公私公平竞争，却让国企垄断集团做大

3、总是强调民族平等，却搞各种地区性郑策，转移支付，两少一宽

4、强调法制，却允许疑罪从有，比如被告提供了完整的不在场证明以及控方证据不足依然判处有罪，辩护律师未到场宣判却已经提前结束

5、说是允许人民聚众集会，但是从不批准，连被驱赶的机会都没有

6、号称维护和平，却暗中资助俄罗斯的侵略战争，也拒绝谴责俄罗斯，反而大肆污蔑被侵略国

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Here’s a natural English translation of your points while keeping the meaning and critical tone intact:

1. Although guns are restricted, other weapons still cause severe harm (e.g., the Zhuhai vehicle attack killing 35, the indiscriminate knife attack in Jiangsu, and the Hubei shooting incident).
2. The media constantly promotes a picture of peace and fairness, yet suppresses outlets that speak the truth. While advocating for fair competition between public and private sectors, state-owned monopolies are allowed to grow unchecked.
3. They always stress ethnic equality, yet implement various regional policies, transfer payments, and “two fewer, one lenient” measures that favor certain areas or groups.
4. They emphasize the rule of law, yet allow “guilty despite reasonable doubt”—even when defendants provide complete alibis and the prosecution lacks sufficient evidence, convictions still occur, sometimes with defense lawyers absent and verdicts prematurely announced.
5. They claim to allow public assemblies, yet hardly ever approve them, leaving citizens with no chance to protest at all.
6. They say they maintain peace, yet secretly support Russia’s aggressive wars, refuse to condemn Russia, and instead launch extensive smears against the nations being invaded.

If you want, I can also help you condense this into a punchy version suitable for social media or an op-ed while preserving the critical points.

我对你说的几点做一些回答，你看是否有道理

1.其他杀伤这个无法避免，哪里也不敢说没有极端的人，比如美国2025年新奥尔良汽车冲撞人事件，总不能禁车吧，您说是吧。

2.中国大陆目前可以称得上四海清平吧，说实话没问题，但是也要考虑社会影响，如果造成动乱，能不管控吗，再有国企垄断的只是关键行业，这是社会主义国家所必须的，比如电力行业如果交给私企，能保证国家的电力安全吗？

3.我承认中国对待少数民族有政策优惠，但是这是为了保护少数民族，因为发展程度不一样，美国强调平等，每个州不也政策不一样吗？

4.众所周知中国实行的是疑罪从无，至于某些案件判决有失公允，违反法制，那属于职务犯罪。

5.人民有聚众集会的自由，但是需要批准。比如国庆阅兵群众的集会，至于您说的对抗政府的游行示威，我承认国家基本上不会批准，因为这是扰乱公共秩序的，我也不希望中国有这种游行示威。

6.你说中国暗中自主俄罗斯，这是需要证据的，不能你张口一说就认为是事实。中国政府多次在公开场合（例如外交部发言人）说过，中国希望早日结束俄乌战争，如果中国资助俄罗斯，战场早就不是今天这样。事实上中国也为俄乌和谈做过很多努力，同时也给乌克兰提供民生物品，只不过乌克兰不要。当然中国也要基于国家利益做出一些决策。另外中国污蔑乌克兰什么了？
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Let me respond to the points you raised and see if this makes sense:

Other forms of harm are unavoidable—no place can claim to have zero extremists. Take, for example, the 2025 New Orleans car-ramming incident in the U.S. You can’t ban cars, right?

Mainland China can currently be considered relatively stable. Speaking the truth is allowed, but social impact must be considered—if it causes unrest, shouldn’t the authorities manage it? As for state-owned monopolies, they exist mainly in key industries, which is necessary in a socialist country. For example, if electricity were handed over to private companies, could the state guarantee the safety of national power supply?

I admit China has preferential policies for ethnic minorities, but this is to protect them because development levels differ. In the U.S., equality is emphasized, yet policies vary from state to state, don’t they?

China generally follows the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.” If some verdicts are unfair or violate the law, that would constitute official misconduct, not a systemic issue.

People have the right to assemble, but approval is required. For example, public gatherings during National Day parades are allowed. As for protests against the government, the state generally does not approve them because they disrupt public order—and honestly, I wouldn’t want such disruptive demonstrations in China either.

Your claim that China secretly supports Russia needs evidence—you can’t just say it and assume it’s true. The Chinese government has publicly stated, for example via the Foreign Ministry, that it hopes for an early end to the Russia-Ukraine war. If China were funding Russia, the war would look very different today. In fact, China has made many efforts to facilitate peace talks and has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine—though Ukraine has refused it. Of course, China must also make decisions based on national interest. Also, what exactly has China “smeared” Ukraine about?

The U.S. emphasizes a free market, yet it subsidizes the military-industrial complex. This shows that “free market” in practice often has exceptions—especially when national security or strategic interests are involved. It’s a blend of market principles and state intervention.

You’re right—saying they “only” target innocent students is too absolute. Gun violence in the U.S. isn’t limited to schools; there are cases in workplaces, public spaces, homes, and streets as well. It’s more accurate to say that school shootings are a highly visible and tragic subset of a broader gun violence problem.

关于补贴，这个中国也有，例如前几年的电动汽车以及光伏。出现这种现象的原因是由于部分产业起步较难，需要政府的部分帮助，等到该企业成熟之后，政府就会取消补贴。当然，目前最让人诟病的还是这个补贴的度，而这个需要市场来反馈。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Regarding subsidies, China has them too—for example, in recent years for electric vehicles and photovoltaics. These arise because some industries are difficult to get off the ground and need partial government support. Once the enterprises mature, the government usually withdraws the subsidies. Of course, the biggest criticism today is often about the scale of these subsidies, and that’s something the market itself needs to provide feedback on.

I’m not saying that all the Americans who are shot are completely “innocent,” nor am I suggesting that victims here—like pedestrians hit by cars or students stabbed with knives—deserve it. Every life lost to violence is tragic. The point is more about visibility, context, and the structural differences in how such incidents are framed and discussed.

呵呵，真是无理搅三分。枪击事件可以禁枪解决，被车撞，难道要禁车吗？美国2024年一共503起大规模枪击案。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Haha, that’s really twisting things unfairly. Gun violence *can* be addressed by regulating guns—but car accidents? Are we supposed to ban cars? In 2024 alone, the U.S. had a total of 503 mass shootings.

针对3和6反驳一下，其他不了解，不予评论
第三点：
老美确实强调平等。你所说的每个州政策不一样是因为别人是联邦制。每个州都是平等，每个州只要在美国宪法框架下，只要流程能通过。都可以自由制定法律
第六点：
中国确实暗中支持俄罗斯，欧盟对俄罗斯的二级制裁，都制裁到中国的国有银行身上了，这还不能说明中国在暗中帮助俄罗斯？
还有一个点，至今为止，中国从未谴责俄罗斯的侵略行为。哪怕是重话，都没说一句
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Point 3:
The U.S. really does emphasize equality. What you mentioned about policies differing by state is because the country has a federal system. Every state is equal under the law—within the framework of the U.S. Constitution, any state can freely enact its own laws as long as the proper processes are followed.

Point 6:
China does secretly support Russia. The EU’s secondary sanctions on Russia have targeted Chinese state-owned banks—doesn’t that indicate China is aiding Russia behind the scenes? Another point: to this day, China has never condemned Russia’s aggressive actions. Not a single strong statement has been made.

对呀，那中国每个省在宪法框架下，制定各省的政策，为什么就不行了？

还有你说欧盟对中国制裁，就说明中国支持俄罗斯了吗，中国跟俄罗斯做正常贸易不行？欧盟是要求中国连和俄罗斯做正常贸易都不可以。中国事实上是中立的，欧盟要求中国站队，凭什么？难道中国不需要考虑自己国家的利益？
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Exactly—then why can’t each Chinese province set its own policies within the framework of the Constitution, just like U.S. states do?

As for your point about the EU sanctioning China—does that really prove China is supporting Russia? China is allowed to conduct normal trade with Russia. The EU is essentially demanding that China not even engage in normal trade with Russia. In reality, China is neutral. Why should the EU dictate which side China must take? Doesn’t China need to consider its own national interests?

1. That “unreliable shot” can’t possibly have been staged, right? Were Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy also students?

2. Doesn’t Huawei know what it did? They broke the rules first! As for TikTok, it’s still operating normally, maintaining huge influence—it hasn’t suddenly been stripped of actual control like some other companies.

I just don’t understand—such a “great” country, yet it’s constantly killing or funding killings abroad. Why are people in the U.S. afraid to go out at night? Why are there so many shootings among its own citizens? What does China’s development have to do with the U.S., and why should it sanction or suppress China? The U.S. claims to have freedom of speech, yet YouTube removes Chinese voices as if it’s a matter of life and death.

Exactly. Here’s a list of the world’s so-called “just” countries—the further down the list, the stronger the “justice” seems to be.
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/1.jpeg ())

The six countries (in blue) that opposed “the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/2.png ())

The four countries (in red) that opposed the “Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/3.png ())

The two countries (in blue) that opposed the “Immediate Lifting of Sanctions on Cuba.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/4.png ())

The two countries (in red) that opposed the “Right to Food as a Human Right.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/5.png ())

The two countries (in red) that opposed the “Resolution Against Glorifying Nazism.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/6.png ())

The only country that refused to sign the “United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.”
![](images/2025/us-a-just-nation/7.png ())

As the saying goes, “true gold fears no fire.” Even the so-called “earthly divine nations” in the eyes of some—Israel, Ukraine, Argentina—couldn’t hold out in the end. The only one that persisted is our G.O.A.T., the United States of America.
Greatness speaks for itself.

Enough already 😂 You probably don’t even know the background of the treaties.
The “Resolution Against Glorifying Nazism” was proposed by Russia. When they invaded Ukraine in 2022, they shouted about “denazification” to label Ukraine as full of neo-Nazis.
As for the others, I don’t even want to explain—most of them are taken out of context. Anyone who actually asked ChatGPT wouldn’t have said stuff like this 😂

Whether it’s “just” or not is hard to say, but the U.S. is definitely not a bad country.

I find it really strange. On one hand, you say China isn’t a fair society, that there’s a privileged class of officials and rich people enjoying perks—that’s your argument. On the other hand, you say the U.S. is free, democratic, and fair, with no privileges and everyone equal—also your argument. And you claim that the rich and officials who move to the U.S. must have sharp judgment and intelligence—again, your argument.

So why would these wealthy officials give up their privileges to go somewhere that doesn’t allow perks, where they can’t stand above others and must be equal with ordinary people? This really makes me question their intelligence and judgment 😂
