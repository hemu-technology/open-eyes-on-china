According to CCTV International News, citing information from the U.S. Navy, at around 2:45 p.m. local time on October 26, an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter belonging to Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 73 crashed into the South China Sea while conducting a mission after taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz. All three crew members on board were rescued.

At approximately 3:15 p.m. local time, an F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet from Strike Fighter Squadron 22 also crashed into the South China Sea shortly after taking off from the USS Nimitz for a mission. Both crew members ejected safely and were recovered.

The U.S. Navy stated that investigations into the causes of the two incidents are currently underway.

It’s interesting that the U.S. military released this report almost immediately after the incidents.

No need for excessive explanation, the basic situation is that the US military is owed wages, and employees are so angry they're smashing machines. The $120 million donation from the mysterious figure may have gone to the Army instead of the Navy, so the Navy needs to make a statement, pressuring Wall Street, the White House, and the Federal Reserve.

还能怎么看待？半小时之内坠机两架，这个坠毁频率无论如何都有点高，这个战机维护和训练水平无论如何都有点低。我没有半点幸灾乐祸的意思，纯粹就是无语，吃惊！

美航母尼米兹号来南海挑衅示威，本来是给到亚洲访问的川总露脸的，结果一不小心把臀露出来了，还一露再露，丢人现眼 。

我现在不得不怀疑，如果PLA趁机对美军下手，美军有没有还手的能力。

How else can we view this? Two planes crashed within half an hour—that crash frequency is undeniably high, and the maintenance and training level of these aircraft is undeniably low. I'm not gloating at all; I'm simply speechless and shocked!

The US aircraft carrier USS Nimitz came to the South China Sea to provoke and demonstrate, originally intended to give Trump a chance to shine during his visit to Asia, but it inadvertently exposed its own shortcomings, and repeatedly so—a truly embarrassing situation.

Now I have to wonder, if the PLA were to take advantage of this opportunity to attack the US military, would the US military have the capability to retaliate?

边打边谈，经典传统了。

刚好中美在贸易谈判，刚好在南海掉了两架美军飞机。

刚好中国各大官号转发。

不过，显然只是在桌子底下互相拧大腿，中国不可能说是自己搞掉的，美国也不可能说是中国搞掉的，但是事实上大家心里都会有个逼数的。

掉这两架飞机至少让美国亏个几百亿。

美刀。

回复一下:如果是被中国搞掉的，还情有可原。如果是自己摔的就更有意思了，连摔两下已经不能用失误或者巧合来解释了。

通常情况下，没有人踹就自己摔倒。通常是老人要不行了的表现。

Fighting while negotiating—a classic tradition.

It just so happens that the US and China are in trade negotiations, and two US military aircraft have just been shot down in the South China Sea.

It just so happens that major Chinese official accounts are reposting this.

However, it's clearly just a power struggle behind the scenes. China can't claim it shot them down, and the US can't claim it was China, but everyone knows the truth.

Shooting down these two planes will cost the US at least tens of billions of dollars.

US dollars.

Reply: If they were shot down by China, it's somewhat understandable. If they crashed on their own, it's even more interesting; crashing twice can't be explained by mistake or coincidence.

Usually, if someone falls down on their own without being kicked, it's usually a sign that an elderly person is about to die.

一天天神叨叨的，但只不过是在猜测，猜测就算了，说的像真的一样，但凡有点常识就知道，你搞掉别人的飞机，就等于宣战，东大做事有这么鲁莽吗？人家坠机不会遮遮掩掩，原因也只有那边才知道，有影响力的军事专家也只是猜测对方可能是舰船老旧，或训练疲劳所致

All this hand-wringing is just guesswork. Wildly asserting that one side “took down” another’s aircraft is tantamount to accusing them of an act of war — a claim that should never be made lightly. Any competent observer knows that if a country actually shot down another nation’s planes, it would be a declaration with consequences. The real reasons for these crashes are known only to the parties involved; influential military analysts are merely offering hypotheses such as aging vessels or crew fatigue.

Your view sounds a bit dated. Claiming that shooting down planes automatically equals a declaration of war? Come on — what about docking fees imposed by Western ports, or the formal stationing of U.S. troops on Taiwanese territory — are those declarations of war too? Wake up: we’re effectively already in a state of confrontation, just not one conducted in the open. Both sides are maneuvering covertly, and whoever gets hurt has to swallow it.

首先，这个事儿首先由国家级官方媒体报道出来，那么一定，一定，是跟我们有直接关系的，但也一定，一定不是因为直接动手，而是某种施压，导致霉菌的战术动作出现了重大失误。

其次，为什么会以一个比较高的密度，在相隔不到一个小时的时间里，接连坠机，而且，一次是直升机，一次是战斗机。那么说明，当时一定是在进行某种程度比较激烈的对抗。至于另一方是谁，不用猜了吧。

第三，直升机在南海这种看不见陆地的地方执行任务，通常不是为了搜救，就是为了反潜。它是第一个坠海的，那就一定不是为了搜救，对吧？那么，大概率就是为了反潜。反谁的潜？

第四，压力当然不会只有水面以下，空中的压力，就需要F18这样的战斗机去应对了。我不信，经验丰富的霉菌，会在弹射大黄蜂这件事情上，犯下低级失误，这都是舰队的基操，属于习惯性操作了。可依然坠海，为什么？只能解释为过于紧张，导致某些动作变形了。那么，为什么会这么紧张？

我猜啊，很有可能，因为某种电子战的原因，让尼米兹舰队觉得如临大敌，觉得对手近在眼前，觉得马上要被打了，才如此慌慌张张的应对。

只能说啊，过去几十年，霉菌的日子太好过了，航母不管去哪，完全都没有工作压力。现在相当于是第一次在他们认为的非常近的距离下，碰到了一个他们认为的更强大的对手，彻底心慌了。

First, the fact that this incident was first reported by a national-level official media outlet means it is definitely directly related to us, but it also definitely wasn't due to direct action, but rather some kind of pressure that led to a major tactical blunder by the US military.

Second, why did two aircraft crash in quick succession, within less than an hour of each other, one a helicopter and the other a fighter jet? This indicates that some kind of intense confrontation was taking place. As for who the other side was, it's obvious.

Third, helicopters operating in the South China Sea, where land is not visible, are usually for search and rescue or anti-submarine warfare. This was the first to crash into the sea, so it certainly wasn't for search and rescue, right? Therefore, it was most likely for anti-submarine warfare. Against which submarines?

Fourth, pressure certainly isn't limited to below the surface; aerial pressure requires fighter jets like the F-18 to handle. I don't believe that the experienced US military would make such a basic mistake in ejecting F/A-18s—it's standard fleet procedure, a habitual operation. Yet it still crashed into the sea. Why? The only explanation is excessive tension, causing some actions to become distorted. So, why such tension?

I suspect it's highly likely that some form of electronic warfare made the Nimitz fleet feel like it was facing a formidable enemy, as if the opponent was right in front of them, and that they were about to be attacked, hence their panicked response.

It just goes to show that for the past few decades, the US Navy has had it too easy; their aircraft carriers have had absolutely no workload, no matter where they go. Now, for the first time, they've encountered what they perceive as a much stronger adversary at what they consider very close range, and they're completely panicked.

直升机起飞并不意味着一定是反潜，搜救直升机在固定翼飞机弹射前都提前起飞，方便固定翼飞机弹射失败时进行及时搜救。有个华裔写的《我在美军航母上的八年》可以看看.如果需要航母上的直升机进行反潜作业，那潜艇得多迫近航母？按照航母打击群的配置，最外围的反潜由外围的驱逐舰或核潜艇来做。非战争状态对方核潜艇能突破重重探测迫近到航母附近，绝对是大新闻了。别美军一有事故，就臆测有什么大杀器....平常心吧

<div class="translated-text">
Helicopter takeoff doesn't necessarily mean anti-submarine warfare. Search and rescue helicopters take off before fixed-wing aircraft catapult launches to facilitate timely search and rescue should the catapult launch fail. There's a book by a Chinese-American author, "My Eight Years on a US Aircraft Carrier," which you might want to read. If carrier-based helicopters are needed for anti-submarine operations, how close would the submarine have to get? According to the configuration of a carrier strike group, the outermost anti-submarine warfare is handled by outer destroyers or nuclear submarines. In peacetime, if an enemy nuclear submarine could break through multiple detection systems and approach an aircraft carrier, that would be major news. Don't assume some kind of superweapon every time the US military has an incident... Let's keep a calm perspective.

即使是东方某国干的，美帝也不能承认，悄咪咪的连续被干掉两架飞机，说明对方已经有碾压性的优势，一旦那些所谓的盟友得知美国已经被别人碾压后，这些国家立马会反过来咬美国一口，绝对比我们狠！

Commentators note that even if an external actor were involved, the U.S. would be unlikely to acknowledge it. Two consecutive aircraft losses quietly suggest a significant capability gap, which could concern allied nations. Others speculate that systemic maintenance and readiness issues within the U.S. fleet may have contributed to the incidents.

很多人说美军不行了，美军想给川普露脸结果露屁股了，有没有一种可能，是美军故意的呢？

毕竟，拱火拱到最后，打仗的可是人家美军自己，不是国会山老爷们。他们知道打起来可能要倒大霉的，那就露个屁股，让某些人也冷静一下。

Many say the U.S. military is struggling. They wanted to show off for Trump, but ended up embarrassing themselves instead. Could it have been deliberate?

After all, the ones actually fighting would be the troops, not Congress. Maybe they just “exposed themselves” a bit to remind some people to calm down. 😅

很明显是被东大打下来的。

美军在东欧都进入乌克兰作战了，在中东撒开花轰炸伊朗从来没问题。

结果一到了东亚，进入乌克兰作战的F35就频繁坠机，在中东撒开花轰炸伊朗的F18就在南海相继坠毁。

如果说真的是美军损管的问题？为什么在东欧和中东都没事？在东亚就各种出事？

答案很明显，这根本不是美军损管的问题，这就是被东大打下来了。

It’s noticeable that the U.S. aircraft keep failing in East Asia. They operate in Eastern Europe and the Middle East without issues, yet in the South China Sea, planes are going down one after another.

If it were just maintenance problems, why haven’t similar issues happened elsewhere? Observers joke that something different is at play in this region.

目前不知道是不是东大下的黑手。其实小日本也莫名其妙掉过飞机，很难不联想是不是东大下的手。不过想确认也不难，就看下次西太航母再偷摸过来掉不掉飞机就行了

如果下次再掉，那就说明东大明确告知西大了，以后这个地盘你过来一次，就得掉点装备

We still don’t know if it was China behind this. Japan has also had some mysterious aircraft accidents, so it’s hard not to speculate.

But it’s easy to check next time a U.S. carrier sneaks into the Western Pacific — if more planes go down, it would suggest a clear warning: enter this area again, and some of your equipment might just “accidentally” be lost. 😅

这事很诡异的，一般一架战斗机掉海里，然后直升机去救人不小心也掉海里可以理解，现在是直升机掉海里了，不是应该先暂停任务都去救人吗，怎么还有战斗机起飞，那说明一定是遇到了很紧迫的情况。

This is weird. Normally, if a fighter goes down, a helicopter goes out to rescue the crew — that makes sense. But this time the helicopter went down first. Shouldn’t all missions pause to rescue it? Yet a fighter still took off, which suggests something urgent was happening. 😅

老大帝国的落幕表演，老骥伏枥，不能饭否！

大漂亮拉跨的军备体系已经不足以支撑在第一岛链的军事存在，业已老化的军事装备更难以应付与东大频繁的军事对峙和冲突，而东大崭新的军备和更长的使用寿命更让大漂亮力不从心。

大漂亮满口蛀牙但胃口极好，偏偏不甘心要刷存在感，心比天高命比纸薄，想证明能饭，直接拉了两坨！

不过鄙人还是希望大漂亮多来，多好的耙子和假想敌，多好的练手和糊脸对象，蓝星找不到第二家了！

The “Old Empire” puts on its final show — still gallant, but clearly past its prime!

The aging military systems can no longer fully support a presence in the First Island Chain. Worn-out equipment struggles to keep up with frequent standoffs and skirmishes, while China’s newer arsenal and longer-lasting tech leave the Old Empire scrambling.

Despite its shortcomings, the U.S. still tries to assert itself — ambitious but overmatched, trying to prove it can “perform” and ended up dropping two planes in the process.

Still, I hope the U.S. keeps showing up — a great practice target and lesson in humility. There’s no other rival like this on the planet!

The Old Empire can’t admit age, can’t accept fate, and definitely can’t give up. Waiting around to die? Absolutely not!

首先，美军军机的出勤率肯定不低，要不然不至于掉海，美国虽然落魄，但还没到俄罗斯库兹涅佐夫那样

其次，估计有年久失修的原因，新飞机不至于弄成这样，海鹰和大黄蜂也都是老飞机了

也有给菲律宾站台的原因，好让菲猴卖力拼命

First, U.S. military aircraft have a high sortie rate — otherwise, they wouldn’t be ending up in the sea. The U.S. may be declining, but it’s not quite at the level of Russia’s Kuznetsov.

Second, aging equipment likely played a role. Newer aircraft wouldn’t fail like this; both the MH-60R “Sea Hawk” and F/A-18F “Super Hornet” are older models.

There’s also the political angle — showing support for the Philippines, encouraging them to take a more aggressive stance.

不知道是不是巧合，美国军方的兰德智库发报告开始吹中国不可战胜论。让美国政府不要寻求和中国对抗，认清现实追求共存，不要鼓动甚至要帮助阻止台湾独立。那么骄傲的美国军方，发这种长他人志气灭自己威风的报告，这种行为要非找一个吹点，只能说美国民主制度优越性有发现自身问题的能力了。

It’s unclear if it’s a coincidence, but the U.S. military’s RAND Corporation just released a report praising China’s “invincibility,” advising the U.S. government not to confront China, to recognize reality, pursue coexistence, and even help prevent Taiwan’s independence.

For such a proud military to issue a report that boosts the other side while seemingly undermining its own authority — if anything, it highlights one advantage of U.S. democracy: the ability to recognize internal problems.

For our generation, this is truly a “never seen before” moment. 😅

美国一直在全球范围维持着远超其他国家的军事力量部署和日常化的军事任务，其任务过程中的事故总量也是全球最多的，在南海的行动事故也不少，公开的信息就包括了撞机，核潜艇触礁和现在的军机坠毁，对于美国军队来说是可以公开的常态。

The U.S. maintains a far larger global military presence than any other country, with routine operations worldwide. Naturally, this leads to a high number of accidents. In the South China Sea alone, publicly reported incidents include mid-air collisions, nuclear submarines running aground, and now aircraft crashes.

For the U.S. military, such accidents are essentially a public normality.

我认为这种意外是非常常见的，之前就有美国潜艇碰撞事件大家还记得吗？

军事装备也是人造装备，本来就是任务强度比较高的，长距离，高机动，有时候追，碰，炸并非是什么不得了的新闻。

现在，这都能是重点新闻，又和国运扯上关系。前面菲律宾那边我们的船小碰一下，这是非常正常的事情。海外媒体就不得了了。

只能说两边都太想赢了，太期待了。

我告诉你，实际上装甲车坦克这种技术装备先进程度和飞机完全不能比，可靠程度这么高的装备，长时间运动的时候，也会掉链子，小碰小撞，这样那样。

我建议大家理性客观一点，如果美国一艘航母沉了，在一次行动中，飞机频繁直掉，就说明美国是真要噶了。

I think these kinds of accidents are very common. Remember previous U.S. submarine collisions?

Military equipment is man-made and operates under high-stress conditions: long distances, high maneuverability, chasing, collisions, explosions — none of this is truly shocking news.

Now, such incidents make headline news and are tied to “national destiny.” Even minor incidents near the Philippines are normal, yet overseas media blow them up.

Both sides just want to “win” and are overly fixated. Honestly, advanced armored vehicles and tanks can’t be compared to aircraft — even highly reliable equipment can fail during extended operations, leading to small accidents.

We should be more rational and objective: if a U.S. carrier sank or aircraft started crashing frequently during operations, then it would indicate serious trouble.
