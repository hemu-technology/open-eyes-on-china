**Why is the UK still considered a world power?**

Britain doesn’t seem to perform that well on the international stage nowadays. Politically and economically, it can hardly compare with itself a hundred years ago, or with the United States today. So why is it still often mentioned alongside the US?

When the Russia–Ukraine war first broke out, it was only the UK that firmly sanctioned Russia and assisted Ukraine. Just for that alone, Britain is a true great power — a real one, not the kind you just “wait and see.” 🐶

Isn’t it just because a war in Europe benefits Britain the most? After all, it doesn’t affect the UK that much, while the main losers are its competitors, France and Germany. The fiercer the Russia–Ukraine war gets, the more excited Britain becomes.

How much aid did they really provide? Isn’t this just like the UN forces during the Korean War — aside from the US military and the South Korean troops filling the front lines, weren’t the others basically just tag-alongs?

The Korean War (1950–1953) was a major Cold War conflict fought on the Korean Peninsula between North Korea (supported by the Soviet Union and later China) and South Korea (supported by the United States and United Nations forces). It ended in an armistice, with the peninsula still divided today.

“美英”并称是因为这两个国家文化相近，有很强的传承关系，现实政治和社会活动之间的联系也非常紧密。就像中国国内会说“两广”，不代表广西跟广东的实力就能相提并论了
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
The US and the UK are often mentioned together because the two countries have similar cultures, a strong historical legacy, and are closely linked in politics and social affairs today. It’s just like how people in China often say “Liangguang” (Guangdong and Guangxi) — it doesn’t mean that Guangxi is on the same level of strength as Guangdong.

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
**Liangguang** (literally *the two Guangs*) is a traditional Chinese term referring to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in southern China. Historically they were administered together, but today the phrase is mostly used as a geographical shorthand and does not imply that the two are equally strong or developed.

从当今世界的主流立场来看：英国是真正的自由主义思想的发源地，宪政体制的先驱者，几百年来，英国在世界范围内一直走在反对极权、反对暴政统治的最前线，也是立场最旗帜鲜明的。美国在这方面比英国差远了

From the perspective of today’s mainstream global view, the UK is the true birthplace of liberal thought and a pioneer of constitutional governance. For centuries, Britain has consistently stood at the forefront of opposing totalitarianism and tyrannical rule, maintaining a very clear stance. The United States falls far behind the UK in this regard.

**Liberal thought** here refers to political philosophy emphasizing individual freedoms, rule of law, and limited government.  
**Constitutional governance** refers to systems where political power is defined and limited by law, as opposed to absolute monarchy or dictatorship.

针对部分回答说的，英国首先援助乌克兰这一事，我怎么记得小泽说的是，约翰逊只答应提供给他跑路的交通工具，小泽说自己现在需要的不是去伦敦的机票而是防空武器，后来挺过去俄罗斯突袭基辅了，英国人才跟着欧盟一起提供的军事援助？
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Regarding some answers claiming that the UK was the first to aid Ukraine, as far as I remember, Zelenskyy said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson only agreed to provide him with transportation to flee. Zelenskyy responded that what he needed at the time wasn’t a ticket to London, but air defense weapons. Only after Ukraine withstood Russia’s sudden assault on Kyiv did the UK join the EU in providing military aid.

这英国还能跟中美比影响力？真的不自量力！主管西方世界财务的代表人耶伦三天两头就到我们中国跑，求着中国，还向我们中国的一个官员进行了三鞠躬。英国用大巴敷衍世界其他国家领导人的时候，专门给中国代表和美国总统安排了专车服务。去年，中国还在北京调停了伊朗和沙特阿拉伯，签订了和平协议。美国还成天在讨论要不要跟中国脱钩，可是从来没有对其他国家这么退让。因此，中国的全球巨大影响力也就美国可以压一压，而英法等国加在一起看都是笑话！

<div class="translated-text">
Can the UK really compare to China or the US in terms of influence? That’s just overestimating itself! Janet Yellen, the head of Western finance, keeps coming to China every few days, essentially begging China, and even performed three bows to a Chinese official. While the UK used buses to deal with other world leaders in a perfunctory manner, it arranged dedicated vehicles for Chinese representatives and the US president. Last year, China even mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Beijing and helped sign a peace agreement. Meanwhile, the US keeps debating whether to decouple from China, but it has never made such concessions to any other country. Therefore, China’s massive global influence can only be checked by the US; even combined, countries like the UK and France are a joke!

**decoupling** refers to discussions about reducing economic dependence on China.

就是英美习惯性并称，英国才狗仗人势的被当成世界大国，普遍上英国被重视的程度不如日本。
另外，国人的观点无所谓，主要看三哥认不认同英国是世界大国，五常出局一个，肯定是三哥踢出英国。三哥还是英国首相，刚超过英国的GDP。
所以英国地位的问题得和三哥辩经。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
The US and UK are habitually mentioned together, which is why Britain gets treated as a world power by leaning on its past influence. In general, Britain isn’t even as respected as Japan.
Moreover, domestic opinions don’t matter — what really counts is whether India recognizes the UK as a world power. If one of the P5 is ousted, it would definitely be Britain. India is still the UK’s prime rival, with a GDP just surpassing Britain’s.
So the question of Britain’s status really has to be debated with India.

The highly upvoted answer is really amazing. The UK, the ultimate troublemaker, in the Munich Agreement, the Boer Wars, the War of 1812, and the Opium Wars — in which of these conflicts was Britain on the side of justice?
As for the so-called “Western alphabet,” it originates from Latin letters, which were indirectly developed from Greek letters around the 7th–6th centuries BCE. These became the writing system of the ancient Romans, whose cultural influence over Western Europe made Latin the official language of ancient and medieval Europe. Even English and German were significantly influenced in vocabulary and grammar.

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
**Munich Agreement (1938)** refers to the agreement allowing Nazi Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia, often criticized as appeasement.  
**Boer Wars (1880–1881, 1899–1902)** were fought between the British Empire and the Boer states in South Africa.  
**War of 1812** refers to the conflict between the US and the UK.  
**Opium Wars (1839–1842, 1856–1860)** were wars between Britain and Qing Dynasty China over trade and sovereignty.

When Queen Elizabeth II of the UK passed away, more than 100 heads of state and government leaders from around the world attended the funeral. With so many leaders, and given the UK’s relatively small size, there weren’t enough dedicated vehicles, so they resorted to transporting leaders in buses, one by one. London streets were literally filled with presidents driving around.

Honestly, the scene was truly unique in the world — even a UN meeting could never gather so many leaders in one place.

**Queen Elizabeth II** was the monarch of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 1952 to 2022. She was one of the longest-reigning monarchs in British history, symbolizing national unity and continuity, with limited political power but significant cultural and diplomatic influence..

This is because Elizabeth was the head of state of the UK, one of the WWII victorious countries, from the war era all the way into the 21st century. Her passing is somewhat like if Stalin or Roosevelt had lived until now and then died — it’s more a historical shock than directly related to modern Britain’s affairs.

**Joseph Stalin** was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1953, leading the USSR during WWII and implementing highly centralized and often brutal domestic policies. In the comment, he symbolizes a historical leader whose passing today would feel like a major historical shock.  
**Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR)** was the President of the United States from 1933 to 1945, leading the country through the Great Depression and WWII. In the comment, he represents a long-past historical figure whose death in modern times would carry extraordinary historical significance.

This is mostly due to Queen Elizabeth II’s personal charisma and influence, not the UK itself.

It was indeed shocking, but claiming that many world leaders came to “pay pilgrimage” is exaggerated. Most normal leaders don’t treat any foreign leader with that kind of reverence; at most, they show respect for a senior statesman.

But before the bombing, Hitler indeed wanted peace. He thought that if Britain were destroyed, the U.S. would emerge as the new global power, so at first he wanted to keep Britain to maintain balance. If Hitler had been determined to destroy Britain from the start, there would never have been the Dunkirk evacuation.

这也是一部分原因。当时英国国内主战派和讲和派也是吵得不可开交。历史就是机缘巧合。两边同时在犹豫才成全了敦克尔顿撤退。胡子当时心要是一横直接把英法联军就地端了历史可能就是截然不同的走向了。

That’s part of the reason. At the time, the British pro-war and pro-peace factions were in fierce dispute. History is full of coincidences. The simultaneous hesitation on both sides allowed the Dunkirk evacuation to happen. If Hitler had been resolute, he could have annihilated the Anglo-French forces on the spot, and history might have taken a completely different course.

真正来说，输出文明的应该就是启蒙运动时期，英法德这些洛克、休谟、康德、孟德斯鸠、卢梭等这些天赋人权、三权分立，君权民授、契约精神、政府论等理论太先进了，后来直接影响亚当斯密建立市场经济，美国建国，独立宣言，法国大革命。这些市场经济、法治、民主选举、多党制竞争、三权分立，是构成现代主流价值观不可缺少的产物
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Strictly speaking, the true “exporters of civilization” were the Enlightenment-era thinkers in England, France, and Germany. Philosophers such as Locke, Hume, Kant, Montesquieu, and Rousseau advanced ideas like natural rights, separation of powers, popular sovereignty, the social contract, and theories of government. These ideas later directly influenced Adam Smith in establishing market economy principles, the founding of the United States, the Declaration of Independence, and the French Revolution.

Market economy, rule of law, democratic elections, multi-party competition, and separation of powers are indispensable components of modern mainstream values.

The UK possesses over 130 Typhoon fighter jets, dozens of F-35Bs, dozens of Apache attack helicopters, various aerial refueling and early warning aircraft, and—even though not great—some aircraft carriers. Its military strength still ranks in the top 10 globally.

The British are indeed capable, and their system is truly excellent. Unfortunately, the country is too small, so it doesn’t really matter. Between nations, only overall strength counts.

英国一直践行自己的战略：亚欧大陆不能有真正的老大，特别是欧洲大陆不能有老大！

The UK has consistently pursued its strategy: there must not be a true dominant power on the Eurasian continent, especially in Europe!

答主要不要了解一下英国几百年来秉承的“离岸平衡”的战略？真以为天底下有无缘无故的爱？[滑稽]

Shouldn’t you first understand the UK’s centuries-long “offshore balancing” strategy? Do you really think there’s unconditional love in this world? 😂

你是不是也认为英国大善人到处殖民杀了那么多人也是因为是个好领袖？

Do you also think that the UK, as a “great benefactor,” colonized and killed so many people all over the world because it was a good leader?

**great benefactor** is used ironically to highlight the contrast between the violent colonial history and the supposed moral authority claimed by Britain.

相反，法国的表现就很喜感，嘴上输出远远高于实际出力，比德国都不如[捂脸]

On the contrary, France’s performance is quite comical—their rhetoric far exceeds their actual contribution, even less than Germany’s. 🤦‍♂️

这种就是比较务实的处理手法，既不失道义有规避了难民潮，本身不用给乌克兰输血还留了日后和俄罗斯和解的后路[赞同]

<div class="translated-text">
This is a relatively pragmatic approach: it maintains a sense of moral stance, avoids a refugee crisis, doesn’t have to “bleed” resources for Ukraine, and still leaves room for future reconciliation with Russia. 👍

**bleed resources** is used metaphorically to describe giving significant aid or support.
