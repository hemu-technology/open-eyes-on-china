This post shares translated comments from Chinese netizens about Russia, revealing a generally critical perspective. Many view Russia as stuck in autocratic traditions and reliant on military force, seeing it as a barrier to global progress and democracy. Vladimir Putin is both criticized and oddly admired, with his leadership seen as contributing to Russia’s stagnation. Some compare Russia unfavorably to the US, noting its confrontational approach. Despite the skepticism, there’s recognition of Russia’s historical significance and some empathy for its people. The post encourages cross-cultural dialogue and highlights the complexity of Chinese attitudes toward Russia.

  <strong style="color: #0077b8;">Overview:</strong><br>
Let’s take a look at how Chinese netizens view Russia. Overall, many Chinese people express strong opinions about Russia, ranging from admiration for its strength to criticism of its actions.

Since the volume of comments is quite large, I’ve decided to publish them in several parts. Below are translations of posts taken from the Chinese equivalent of Quora. I haven’t filtered them based on personal preference, and I’ve tried to keep the translations as fair and unbiased as possible.

You’re also welcome to share your own thoughts on Russia and China in the comments. If you do, I can translate them into Chinese and post them on Chinese forums so that more people there can see how you view Russia and China.

Russia is a country whose mindset is still stuck in the era of feudal despotism, a barbaric state that still seeks to conquer the world through force. It has become an obstacle to humanity's progress toward greater freedom, democracy, fairness, and civilization, and serves as the ultimate backer of the world's evil forces and terrorists!

只知道有一个整容打玻尿酸的玉皇大帝(普京)，有很多女粉丝，甚至愿意为他生孩子，但他治国能力确实不敢恭维，给他20年，他给本国一个破败不堪落后的俄罗斯，整天举着核大棒叫嚣与世界同归于尽。[捂脸]

All I see is a so-called 'Jade Emperor' (Putin) obsessed with cosmetic surgery and Botox, surrounded by female fans who would even bear children for him. Yet his ability to govern leaves much to be desired: after twenty years in power, he has delivered nothing but a dilapidated and backward Russia, while brandishing nuclear weapons and shouting about dragging the whole world down with him.😏

Russia really only relies on brute force, and it’s far behind the U.S. The U.S. doesn’t just use force—they also use infiltration. Over the years, there have been domestic spy arrests, the 2019 Hong Kong protests, and countless sanctions. The U.S. has a lot of tools to maintain its hegemony.

打了快三年了，俄罗斯和整个北约在乌克兰对耗，伤亡70多万青壮年军人，精锐装甲兵和装备大部分被歼，黑海舰队被打得只剩下了黑海，炮弹、导弹也打空了，不得不向朝鲜、伊朗买炮弹、导弹和无人机来维持战争，出高价请朝鲜军人助战了。现在为增加粮食出口换外汇来维持战争，还不得不搞粮食凭票配给制度。卢布的通胀也日益严重，战争引发的经济危机正在漫延全国………………当年一次世界大战时的沙皇俄罗斯帝国就是在战争进入第三年后不久，因为战争引发的经济危机而导致.二月革命和十月革命相继爆发而崩溃的……现在的.俄罗斯能否撑过明年而国民经济不崩溃都两说呢！！！！！！大鹅喜欢打仗，但不善于打胜仗，喜欢靠大量的败仗去堆人头，用自己人的血和脑浆去淹死对方，一但对手太过强大大鹅可能就会因为耗不下去而崩溃掉，克里米亚战争、日俄战争和一次世界大战都是这样败的…………谁如果把普鲸大弟当偶像的话赶紧为他祈祷吧！！因为他真的需要很多很多很多(此处省略一万个很多)的好运气才行呢！！

The war’s been dragging on for almost three years. Russia 🦢 vs NATO in Ukraine—over 700,000 young soldiers gone, elite armored units shredded, the Black Sea Fleet barely holds the Black Sea. Ammo and missiles? Gone. Russia has to buy shells, missiles, and drones from North Korea and Iran 💸, even paying for North Korean soldiers to fight.

To keep exporting grain for foreign currency, they’ve had to ration food at home. Ruble inflation is skyrocketing, and the economy is teetering…

Back in WWI, Tsarist Russia collapsed after just three years of war-triggered economic chaos. Can modern Russia survive next year without economic meltdown? 🤷‍♂️

The Big Goose 🦢 loves war but sucks at winning. It piles up its own people as cannon fodder, drowning enemies in blood, but strong opponents could make it crumble. Crimean War ✅ Russo-Japanese War ✅ WWI ✅ same story.

If you idolize Comrade Whale 🐋, pray hard 🙏—he’s going to need an absurd amount of luck (like, ten thousand “lots” of luck) to get through this!!

可怜的俄罗斯，让你把它妖魔化成了这样。要知道，自苏联解体后，俄罗斯就放弃了社会主义制度，改成了资本主义制度，而且俄罗斯是核大国，是五常之一，没有两把刷子，能在五常位置呆得住?

如果俄是落后，专制野蛮的国家，美西方为何和那么害怕俄罗斯?全世界都患有恐俄症，这种病毒还感染了中国国内的崇尚西方价值观的亲美分子。

在俄乌冲突中，美西方从常规武器到豹2坦克，到集束炸弹、贫铀弹。能用的武器都用上了，黔驴技穷，也没能扳倒俄罗斯。事实证明俄罗斯是世界第二军事强国。

Poor Russia 🦢, turned into such a demonized image. Keep in mind, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia abandoned socialism and switched to capitalism. It’s also a nuclear power and one of the UN Security Council’s five permanent members—if it didn’t have some real capabilities, could it really hold that position?

If Russia were truly backward, despotic, and barbaric, why are the U.S. and Western countries so afraid of it? The whole world suffers from “Russophobia,” a virus that has even infected pro-Western, America-loving factions within China.

In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the West has used everything from conventional weapons to Leopard 2 tanks, cluster bombs, and depleted uranium munitions. They’ve exhausted all tricks, yet still haven’t been able to topple Russia. The facts prove that Russia is the world’s second-strongest military power.

The Soviet Union is the Soviet Union, Russia is Russia. Tsarist Russia made us cede territory and pay reparations, pillaging and burning along the way. Millions of square kilometers—some say it was “leased,” but they never returned it. Hong Kong and Macau were also leased for 100 years, yet they were returned. By your logic, it would be the Americans who helped us resist Japan and drove them out—they didn’t even take an inch of our land. The Americans must be saints.

The world would be a better place without Russia 🦢. They haven’t contributed much to humanity; what they export is mostly poverty, death, and threats. Their strength often means the destruction or subjugation of others. They’ve been a disaster for humanity since the little principality of Moscow, having already annexed dozens of countries. If they succeed in annexing Ukraine this time, the “Bear” will grow even stronger, posing a massive threat to both East and West.

一个贪得无厌恶霸国家，长期对外扩张从一个弹丸莫斯科小公国成为世界第一大幅员辽阔的国家，大部分领土都是由武力和杀戮从领国掠夺，历史上吞并掠夺了中国大幅国土，杀害我同胞，多起震惊世界的血案大屠杀，造成今天的俄罗斯远东地区不见一个原住民，这就是对俄罗斯的影响，极其厌恶，俄罗斯是中国永远的敌人。

A greedy and tyrannical country, Russia 🦢 has long pursued external expansion, growing from a tiny Moscow principality into the world’s largest country by land. Most of its territory was seized through force and slaughter. Historically, it annexed large parts of China’s territory, killed countless of our compatriots, and carried out multiple massacres that shocked the world. As a result, today’s Russian Far East has no indigenous population left. This is the legacy of Russia—extremely detestable. Russia will always be China’s enemy.

从中国历史角度看原沙俄在我清朝时期吞占我三百多万平方公里领土，用武力迫使清政府签订不平等条约，在西方列强瓜分我国利益时趁火打劫，对我国经济、社会及领土主权造成了极大的损害，是实实在在的罪人。

From the perspective of Chinese history, Tsarist Russia seized over three million square kilometers of our territory during the Qing Dynasty, forcing the Qing government to sign unequal treaties by military pressure. It took advantage of the scramble by Western powers to plunder China, causing immense damage to our economy, society, and territorial sovereignty. It was truly a criminal perpetrator.

蒙古化的斯拉夫，蒙古帝国的精神继承人。历史上长期受蒙古的影响变得极其野蛮，只不过因为白人血统和一些历史原因构成的光环骗了不少南边的人。有些人嘲笑日韩靠近欧美是跪舔白人，却完全不看自己怎么跪舔俄罗斯这个白人国家。

Slavs shaped by Mongol influence—the spiritual heirs of the Mongol Empire. Historically, they were long exposed to Mongol rule and became extremely brutal. Yet their white ancestry and some historical quirks created a halo that fooled many people to the south. Some mock Japan and South Korea for cozying up to the West as “bootlicking white people,” but they fail to see how they themselves fawn over Russia 🦢, this white country.

Between China and Japan, it was 35 million back then, which converts to a “national blood debt” of 150 million today.

Domestic media loves to guide people to blame the U.S., making it seem like everything is caused by America. In reality, without the U.S., we wouldn’t have developed so fast. In 2000, the U.S. helped us join the WTO. After WWII, the U.S. crushed Japan, banned them from developing nuclear weapons, and destroyed their military. Companies like Apple and Tesla spurred China’s own smartphone and EV industries, creating countless jobs. Befriending strong countries brings benefits—they’re the best teachers.

A Historical Critique of the Soviet and Russian Regimes
From the moment the Soviet empire was established, why did its Comintern just disappear? After the Soviet empire realized it couldn't stand alone as a two-headed eagle and polar bear, it created the Warsaw Pact. The Berlin Wall fell, the Warsaw Pact dissolved, and the Soviet Union perished.

The Russian Federation then emerged from the ashes of the USSR. Its two-headed eagle’s eyes were fixed on NATO, and it submitted multiple applications, eagerly hoping to join the alliance. But the polar bear was a pariah, unwanted by all, and its dream was ultimately shattered. Under the polar bear's influence, a "poisonous union" was formed—a Commonwealth of Independent States—but everyone had their own agenda, and it has essentially been a union in name only for a long time. The disgruntled polar bear then assembled the CSTO gang. Let's see if these misfits can really hold up the banner.

The history of Tsarist Russia goes without saying, and the crimes of the Soviet empire are no less than those of its predecessor. During World War II, China was an anti-fascist ally and a victorious nation, so why did the Soviet mob boss, Stalin, conspire with traitors and rebels in Outer Mongolia to stage a "color revolution" and hold a referendum for independence? This caused China to lose jurisdiction over Outer Mongolia.

With the help of American atomic bombs on Japan, the Soviet Red Army invaded Northeast China, so why did they plunder the entire region of its wealth? Are they not genetically predisposed to leaving no stone unturned, inheriting the very genes of Tsarist Russia?

Stalin sent the KGB to assassinate Yugoslavian President Tito three times without success. President Tito sent a letter back to the Soviet mob boss: "If you send the KGB to assassinate me one more time, I will send one person to take you out." From then on, Stalin was terrified and dared not be reckless again.

The Soviet Union then invaded Czechoslovakia, giving the act a pleasant-sounding name, "Prague Spring." It also invaded China at Zhenbao Island, using nuclear blackmail to intimidate China. Yet, in that war, our People's Liberation Army captured the Soviet Union's most advanced T-62 tank. The Soviet thugs racked their brains but couldn't get the tank back, and the evidence of their crime is now on display at the Chinese Military Museum.

The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan lasted ten years, and they were eventually forced to withdraw in the face of global condemnation. Later, the Soviet Union colluded with the Vietnamese upstart, which was harassing Chinese border residents. In the end, China's counter-attack in self-defense against Vietnam achieved a complete victory. While fighting Vietnam, we were really slapping the Soviet mob on the face.

你知道吗，没有我们，俄罗斯撑不了这么久，视情况我们会加大支持的力度，我们不会也不能让他们输，我们希望就这样继续慢慢给美国放血，你心中信仰的美丽国，现在已经像个疾病缠身的老人，2024年一月，美债规模已经突破三十四万亿美元，2023年全年GDP才27万亿美元，如果你稍微懂一点经济知识应该会明白这对一个国家意味着什么，但美元信用是美国人最后的一根拐杖，我们国家已经完成了外资管控，他们割不了我们，现在他们正像热锅上的蚂蚁，满世界找韭菜，去年收割了欧洲一把，给他续了命，今年已经找不到收割对象了，小国家三瓜两枣根本无济于事，我们不急，坐看他们美债坐火箭，然后违约，看他美元信用塌方，你要杠先找个懂经济的人问问，看你强大的美丽国撑不撑的住[微笑]

You know, without us, Russia couldn't have held on for so long. Depending on the situation, we will increase the intensity of our support. We will not, and cannot, let them lose. We hope to continue slowly bleeding America like this.

The beautiful country you believe in is now like a diseased old man. In January 2024, the U.S. national debt already exceeded 34 trillion dollars, while its full-year GDP in 2023 was only 27 trillion dollars. If you know even a little bit about economics, you'll understand what this means for a country. But the credibility of the U.S. dollar is the last crutch Americans have. Our country has already completed its control of foreign capital, so they can't "harvest" us. Now they're like ants on a hot pan, scouring the world for "leeks" to harvest. Last year, they harvested Europe, which gave them a new lease on life, but this year they can't find anyone else to exploit. The small sums from minor countries are completely useless.

We're not in a hurry. We'll just watch their debt skyrocket, and then default. We'll watch as the dollar's credibility collapses. If you want to argue with me, go ask someone who understands economics first to see if your powerful beautiful country can hold on. 😊

You don't need to be here waving the flag for America. The once-powerful Soviet Union also collapsed in an instant. You should adjust your mindset; America is not a god, nor is it your holy temple. Their advantages over us are rapidly disappearing, and almost all of their high-tech industries are being hunted down by us. Their room to maneuver is being squeezed, and they are being surpassed and destroyed. You can deny it, but the reality is playing out.

The Soviet thugs racked their brains but couldn't get the tank back, and the evidence of their crime is now on display at the Chinese Military Museum.

The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan lasted ten years, and they were eventually forced to withdraw in the face of global condemnation. Later, the Soviet Union colluded with the Vietnamese upstart, which was harassing Chinese border residents. In the end, China's counter-attack in self-defense against Vietnam achieved a complete victory. While fighting Vietnam, we were really slapping the Soviet mob on the face.

Is it still the case that there are some traitors and scoundrels singing the praises of the two-headed eagle and the polar bear?

You're talking about the big picture with me? Aren't you too gutsy? Have you ever heard of a sovereign with a heart that can embrace the universe? Are you saying the idea of "a heart higher than the heavens, a life thinner than paper" is outdated?

The human world is fundamentally animalistic, with hegemonism running rampant and special privileges everywhere. Are you telling me you don't want to become a king and dominate? If a sovereign were to put the UN Security Council in their pocket and walk away, do you think it would blow up? You're trying this with me? You're quite a bit more naive, aren't you?

我跟你说的就不是一回事，说的是要先拿回俄罗斯东北那片地方，目前的形势并不是拿回来的时机，只有强大起来各方面无惧美国或者超越美国时，否则就像三国，蜀和东吴任何一方都不如曹操，但是后边因为荆州和关羽的事情魏国还没有倒下就内讧了

What I'm saying is not the same thing. I'm saying that we must first take back that northeastern region of Russia. The current situation is not the right time to reclaim it. We can only do so when we become strong enough to fearlessly face the U.S. in all aspects, or to surpass it.

Otherwise, it would be like the Three Kingdoms period: neither Shu nor Eastern Wu could match Cao Cao, but they later turned on each other over the matter of Jingzhou and Guan Yu before the State of Wei had even fallen.

Are you naively fantasizing about the two-headed eagle and the polar bear returning to the era of Tsarist Russia and the Soviet empire? Do you think the polar bear wants China to be strong? The Russian mob boss only wants Belarus and Ukraine to be Russian territory.

Why did the Comintern and the Warsaw Pact created by the Soviet empire all disappear? Aren't the poisonous union and the CSTO gang created by Russia just barely clinging to life and falling apart? Isn't this just because the Russian polar bear is a pariah, unwanted by all?

Russia's economy is a mess. The Soviet Union's collapse was just because the other states were too poor, and Russia itself couldn't afford to maintain them. Of course, Russia doesn't want China to be strong; both sides think the same way. [Facepalm] Both sides are also fully aware of this. China and Russia have their own conflicts, but everyone is clear that the most important enemy right now is the U.S. We have to distinguish between the primary and secondary contradictions.

From the Russia-Ukraine war or previous Russian foreign wars, you should be clear that for Chinese people, Russia is actually easier to deal with than the U.S. The Americans can come at you with all-out suppression. Neither China nor Russia can beat the U.S. alone. If either side falls, rest assured, your life will definitely be worse than it is now. It's not that Russia's problems won't be dealt with, the time just isn't right yet.

The great game between nations relies on national strength, what matters is science and technology, and the key is still education. If you could become a global hegemon just by shouting slogans, wouldn't that be too easy? And you still hope the two-headed eagle and the polar bear will take a bullet for you? Isn't that just a pipe dream? Do you even know what it means to put yourself in another's shoes?

美国打日本和苏共都是因为利益，谁说喊口号了，这跟喊口号有什么关系，没有说俄罗斯会主动给你躺枪啊，而且双方都明白，任何一个人单独都不是美国的对手，只能暂时联手，世界不是非黑即白，不同时期，不同阶段，敌人和盟友都只是暂时的，都是不断变化的，分清楚主要矛盾和次要矛盾，大国博弈靠的是综合实力，武力是保障，否则科技教育你也没时间发展起来，或者发展起来给别人做嫁衣，就像宋朝一样，我国古代经济最好的时代有用吗，清政府占全世界那么高的经济有用吗，目前很明显的就是美国把主要战略放在东亚了，就是中国，比俄罗斯威胁还大，不是明摆的事情吗？，一山不容二虎，美国衰落了，到时候中俄也会自然把彼此矛盾放大的，当然不是说科技教育不重要，而且和军事齐头并进，目前形势俄罗斯倒了，难道中国会好过吗？短暂的支持俄罗斯难道就是俄罗斯利益高于中国了，你这还关键科技教育呢，就这认知，搞出来了也是为别人做嫁衣
</small>
</details>
<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The U.S. fought Japan and the Soviet Union for its own interests, so what does that have to do with shouting slogans? Nobody said Russia would take a bullet for you, and both sides understand that neither can stand alone against the U.S. They can only temporarily join forces. The world isn't just black and white; at different times and stages, enemies and allies are temporary and constantly changing. One must distinguish between the primary and secondary contradictions.

The great game between nations relies on comprehensive national strength, and military force is the guarantee. Otherwise, you won't have the time to develop your science and technology, or your advancements will just end up benefiting someone else. It's like the Song Dynasty; what good was it that it had the best economy in ancient China? What good was it that the Qing government accounted for such a high share of the world's economy?

It's clear right now that the U.S. has placed its main strategy on East Asia, specifically China, a threat even greater than Russia. Isn't that an obvious matter? A mountain cannot hold two tigers. When the U.S. declines, Russia and China will naturally amplify their conflicts. Of course, this isn't to say that science and technology and education aren't important; they should advance alongside military strength. In the current situation, if Russia falls, do you really think China would be better off? Does temporarily supporting Russia mean that Russia's interests are placed above China's? With this kind of understanding of yours—that the key is science and education—even if you succeed, you'll just be making a wedding dress for someone else.

Domestic public opinion loves to stir up public sentiment against the U.S., thinking everything is caused by America. In reality, without the U.S., we would not have developed so fast.

In 2000, the U.S. let us join the WTO. During WWII, the U.S. brought Japan to its knees, and also forbade them from developing nuclear weapons and destroyed their weapons. Companies like Apple and Tesla drove the development of China's domestic mobile phones and new energy vehicles, creating countless jobs. The benefits of befriending an excellent country—the best teacher.

Yes, I hate evil with a passion. The Russians committed atrocities in the Northeast for many years. They stole the seaports of Heilongjiang and Jilin and encircled them. If we hadn't resisted back then, the three northeastern provinces would be under Russian rule now, turned into new gray beasts.

The three northeastern provinces particularly hate the Russians. Of course, there are some who don't, since the Russians raped many women in the Northeast, and it's quite normal for them to have left behind half-breeds.
