The Trump administration is considering a plan to curb a dizzying array of software-powered exports to China, from laptops to jet engines, to retaliate against Beiing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions, according to a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

While the plan is not the only option on the table, it would make good on President Donald Trump's threat earlier this month to bar "critical software" exports to China by restricting global shipments of items that contain U.S. software or were produced using U.S. software.

On October 10, Trump said in a social media post that he would impose additional tariffs of 100% on China's U.S.-bound shipments, along with new export controls on "any and all critical software" by November 1 without further details.

![Exclusive-US considering curbs on exports to China made with US software, sources say](images/2025/sources curbs.jpeg (Trump is considering a plan to restrict the export of various products containing American software to China))

To be sure, the measure, details of which are being reported for the first time, may not move forward, the sources said.

But the fact that such controls are being considered shows the Trump administration is weighing a dramatic escalation of its showdown with China, even as some within the U.S. government favor a gentler approach, according to two of the sources.

The White House declined to comment. The Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, did not respond to requests for comment.

我们有很多牌可以打，比如波音。下一步，可以针对波音的货运飞机，客运飞机等制裁，只要是波音的产品，航线经过中国，就可以提高停泊费用。针对波音，好处很多，欧洲也乐于袖手旁观。

We have many cards to play — for example, Boeing. Next, we could impose sanctions targeting Boeing’s cargo planes, passenger planes, and so on. As long as it’s a Boeing product and the route goes through China, docking fees could be raised. There are many advantages to targeting Boeing, and Europe would be happy to stand by and watch.

The Americans are out of tricks and only know tariffs — that’s about all the courage they have. People around the world actually hope the U.S. will do that, because those gaps would be their best opportunity.

我有点激动，因为我大概清楚国内软件行业的开发和本土推广能力。
我很期待，期待东大软件人的超级爆发，期待我们软件业卷出去的那天，当然需要国家的布局和规划。

懂王，不，现在该叫投粪王和它的草台班子完全就是相当想当然的、气急败坏的无能报复。
它们会看到一个类似于新能源的产业的新爆发，东大软件业原来被某些买办、一门忠烈坑的太惨，我们的一些行业精英和人才被欺压太过！

总之这事要成真就衷心感谢投粪王，到时候我们软件生态有小成了必给奶颁发一吨重的大勋章

I’m genuinely excited because I know well the development strength and domestic promotion capability of China’s software industry.
I look forward to an explosive rise of our own developers — a moment when Chinese software truly competes globally. Of course, this requires strategic planning and national coordination.
As for Trump and his team, their reaction seems like a desperate and short-sighted retaliation born out of frustration. Ironically, it may trigger a new wave of innovation in China’s software sector, much like the boom in new energy industries.
If that happens, we might even have to thank him — for pushing us to build a stronger, more independent software ecosystem.

好像没啥用吧，美国软件公司没了中国市场，要亏很多钱，美国老资本家们估计会破防。而且这些美国软件国产也有替代，不管是日常软件还是工业软件都有国产替代。之前国产用的少，只是大众普遍习惯了用这些美国软件，如果政策非逼着用国产，切换也就是年了半载的事。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
The policy may backfire. Once American software companies lose access to the Chinese market, their revenues will take a heavy blow — something U.S. investors won’t be happy about. Meanwhile, China already has domestic alternatives for nearly all major software products, from consumer applications to industrial systems. The only reason they haven’t been fully adopted is habit. If policy incentives shift, the transition to local solutions could happen within months.

你这话说的，清军从1644年停滞到1840也没人威胁到他们的统治地位。
但是从1840年到1912年，清军练新军练得如火如荼，也没保住溥仪的皇位。

That’s not necessarily true. The Qing army was stagnant from 1644 to 1840, yet no one seriously threatened their rule. But from 1840 to 1912, even though the Qing government trained new armies with great enthusiasm, it still couldn’t save Emperor Puyi’s throne. Things are always shaped by both internal and external factors.

软件管制对中国境内短期内有影响甚至有痛苦，但中长期都有国产替代，影响可克服。真正影响的是出口的那部分，华为被制裁至今，手机业务不说满血复活但也差不多了，但是国际市场几乎仍然是0，要知道被制裁前可是全球前三甚至前二。美国软件制裁，中国出口的手机、电脑等等国际市场几乎都要归零。
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
Software restrictions may cause short-term pain within China, but in the medium to long term, domestic alternatives exist and the impact is manageable. The real damage would be to exports. Take Huawei, for example: despite sanctions, its domestic smartphone business hasn’t fully recovered, but it’s close, yet its international market remains almost zero — remember it used to be in the global top three, even top two. If the U.S. applies software sanctions, China’s exports of smartphones, computers, and other tech products could be virtually wiped out.

Trump is shorting software giants like Microsoft and Apple — essentially shorting the entire tech sector. He waits for the stock prices to drop, then buys in.

This scenario has already played out twice just this month.

If you hold relevant stocks, it’s time to sell. If you don’t, watch Trump’s real social media 24/7 these days: the moment he signals he no longer wants to use software sanctions against China, these stocks will rebound — a chance to ride the wave.

The U.S. stock market, bond market, and crypto markets would take an even bigger hit than last time, when Trump’s rhetoric alone caused chaos.

Previously, Trump tried to leverage the principal’s position in goods trade — and failed miserably. Now he’s trying from the position of the counterparty to undermine the U.S.’s foundational service trade?

Is Trump really prepared to be taken down internally within six months?

川建国为了祖国的建设真是鞠躬尽瘁。

这是生怕祖国的发展有短板啊。

别管这次中美贸易谈的结果如何，

按东大的习惯，应该会全面梳理各行各业的外国软件，

然后嘛，你懂的。

Trump really seems to be working tirelessly for the sake of his “motherland.”

It’s as if he’s worried there might be any weak spots in the country’s development.

Regardless of the outcome of the latest U.S.-China trade talks, following the usual practices in China, all industries will likely conduct a thorough review of foreign software — and then, well… you know how it goes.

不是大哥，特朗普加税最开始的借口是，“你们赚了美国钱”。

但是美国货贸对中国是出超，服贸对中国是入超啊，是赚中国钱的啊。

现在他打算自己断掉赚中国钱的生意？

神经病？

No, bro — Trump’s original excuse for tariffs was, “You’re making money off the U.S.”

But U.S. goods trade with China runs a surplus, while service trade runs a deficit — it’s actually the U.S. that’s making money off China.

Now he’s planning to cut off the business that earns the U.S. money from China?

Is he crazy?

受影响的中国用户其实真要算下来，只有苹果用户。

安卓、linux，都是开源的，明面上禁了可以换个名字继续用。

windows倒是不开源，不过指望PC系统打击中国，真是想多了。微软每年在中国的正版用户占比，达到所有用户的两位数了吗？

Actually, if you count the Chinese users who would be truly affected, it’s mostly just Apple users.

Android and Linux are open source — even if officially banned, they can continue under a different name.

Windows isn’t open source, but expecting a PC OS to cripple China is wishful thinking. Has Microsoft ever reached even double-digit percentage of all legit PC users in China per year?

只要国家想要发展下去早晚都会走到这一步。

利用各自的优势产业，互相封锁，不断加码。进入对方底线区施压。

直到决出优胜者前双方的关系是不会有好转。

这就是几乎全球的人都认为第三赛季即将来临的原因。

中年的狮王虽然不复壮年，但依然还有处在生态链顶端的战斗能力。

同时新一代的雄狮们也集体进入壮年期。

If a country wants to keep developing, sooner or later it will reach this stage.

Each side leverages its key industries, blocks the other, and keeps raising the stakes — pressing into the other’s red lines.

Until a clear winner emerges, relations between the two sides will not improve.

This is why nearly everyone around the world believes that “Season Three” is about to begin.

The middle-aged lion king may no longer be in his prime, but he still possesses the fighting power of a top predator in the ecosystem.

At the same time, the new generation of lions is entering its prime.

The savannah is only so big — there cannot be two kings.

问题是，美国作为主导全球化的最大受益者，美国无数的跨国企业在华利益巨大，怎么限制？况且老美目前所有的手段都是在虚拟的产业方面，比如软件，金融，科技，这些在中国占全球工业产值超过30%的事实基础上，最终损害的，是全球所有的工业品供应。

川普真是不靠谱！
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
The problem is that the U.S., as the main architect and biggest beneficiary of globalization, has countless multinational corporations with huge interests in China — how could it possibly restrict them? Moreover, the U.S.’s current measures all target virtual industries, like software, finance, and tech. Given that China accounts for over 30% of global industrial output, the ultimate damage would fall on the supply of industrial goods worldwide.

Trump is really unreliable!

这个最大的bug是，稀土规模小，软件规模大。稀土如果违约可以禁售第三国，软件比较难，禁售第三国也受不了。除非血盟，二级制裁实施难度其实比稀土更大。

所以估计也就是美国吓唬一下，没什么用的概率大。欧日韩现在还不一定跟美国一条心，全球只有美国禁一下没太大用。

如果真的跟俄罗斯一样直接脱钩，我估计欧美先受不了的概率更大一些。

The biggest flaw here is that rare earths are small in scale, while software is huge. If China restricts rare earths, it can stop sales to third countries, but software is much harder — even third-party restrictions would be intolerable. Unless there’s a “blood alliance,” implementing secondary sanctions is actually more difficult than controlling rare earths.

So it’s likely that the U.S. is just trying to intimidate — the chances of real impact are low. Europe, Japan, and South Korea aren’t necessarily on the same page with the U.S.; a U.S.-only ban wouldn’t do much globally.

If China fully decoupled like Russia, I think the probability that Europe and the U.S. would suffer first is actually higher.
