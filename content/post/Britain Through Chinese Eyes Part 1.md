  <strong style="color: #0077b8;">OP:</strong>

**Did Britain really dominate the world?**

It seems they only had their moment of glory at sea, and got an early start with the Industrial Revolution.
Within Europe—

In terms of military strength, Britain’s population was small, and it was a peripheral country in Europe, mostly playing balance-of-power politics from its island.

Britain itself wasn’t even that unified, while France and Spain had been united much earlier.

In terms of population and geography, the Holy Roman Empire had far more people and sat at the core of Europe.

In literature—France crushed them.

In mathematics—France crushed them.

In music—the Holy Roman Empire crushed them.

In art—France crushed them.
...
Napoleon even tried to unify Europe. What did the British ever achieve?

The legacy of the British Empire? Even in terms of population, it was no match for Spain, the older colonial empire. Even America today is becoming more “Spanish-ized.”

Britain was always isolated from continental Europe, far from the core regions of Eurasia, and never had a large population to begin with. It feels like Britain was just an average small country, maybe on the same level as Spain. Yet we seem to know and emphasize Britain so much. In comparison, Germany and France are quite underrated (especially France). And countries like Turkey and Iran are even more underestimated—both had larger populations than Britain; one once spanned across Europe, Asia, and Africa and still holds the Eurasian core, the other is a civilization with thousands of years of history, yet our impression of them is just “barbaric.”

So why does Britain have such an outsized reputation, one that doesn’t match its real strength? Is this just a side effect of America’s rise? (Unlike Britain, the U.S., thanks to timing, geography, and human factors, really does have comprehensive global hegemony today.)

They’re not wrong—Britain never even dominated Europe, so where does this claim of “ruling the world” come from??

有理不在声高，如果你连英国从未无力称霸欧洲，连同一个岛上的苏格兰都无力征服，最后还要靠平等条件拉人入伙，连英国从未有能力征服一个可观的白人国家都不知道。连英国自己被一堆的白人小国征服过，而且被其中一个永久性征服无力复仇都不知道，你哪来的底气攻击人家？

It’s not about who shouts louder—what matters are the facts.
If you don’t even know that Britain never had the power to dominate Europe…
If you don’t even know that Britain couldn’t fully conquer Scotland on the very same island, and in the end had to pull them in under equal terms…
If you don’t even know that Britain never had the ability to conquer any significant white nation…
If you don’t even know that Britain itself was conquered by a bunch of small white countries—and one of them even conquered it permanently, leaving Britain powerless to take revenge…

Then where do you get the confidence to attack others?

Modern democracy and the rule of law both originated in Britain.

And without even looking too far back, the peaceful, non-violent Scottish independence referendum has already written a remarkable chapter in the history of human civilization.

另外数学自然科学法国并不更强，现代的多少数理化单位都是英国的科学家命名的？法国确实有但就凭我还在接触理工科的印象并不多。19世纪后开始也是德国更强轮不到法国。至于其他人文方面的，英国确实就比较一般了，但文学并不算落后。艺术方面法国强，但意大利也强。地中海国家都不错。这些都是软实力，和国力没有直接关系
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Also, France wasn’t really stronger in mathematics or the natural sciences. How many modern units in math, physics, and chemistry are actually named after British scientists? France has some, sure, but from my experience in STEM, it’s not that many. After the 19th century, Germany became dominant, not France.

As for other areas in the humanities, Britain was pretty average, though not exactly backward in literature. In art, France was strong, but so was Italy—Mediterranean countries generally did well. These are all soft power aspects and don’t directly reflect national strength.

法国从一开始和英国杠上就一直被英国压着跑，非洲好的殖民地都在英国手里，印度一开始葡萄牙荷兰法国都试图垄断和它的贸易，最后完全被英国垄断近两百年，法国被赶得就剩四五个城市设点。这个算不算英国的实力？北美洲殖民，法国殖民地因为打输了英国所以被英国被迫中立，实际上相当于吞并，最后法国人廉价卖给美国。也就是今天的北美大平原地区。印巴都是英国的势力范围，19世纪中期正式并入英帝国行列，而不只是垄断当地贸易。同时英国的GDP一直都在中印后的最前列（而且中印都是纯自然经济，不同于英国工业化后的经济结构），工业实力一直领先知道二次工业革命后被美国德国超过。但超过的仅仅是英国本土，回到刚刚说的就是它还有全世界土地五分之一大的殖民地供着。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
From the very beginning, whenever France clashed with Britain, it was always pushed around. The best colonies in Africa were in British hands. In India, Portugal, the Netherlands, and France all tried to dominate trade at first, but in the end, Britain monopolized it for nearly two centuries. France was left with just a handful of trading posts in a few cities. Does that count as a measure of British strength?

In North America, French colonies lost to Britain and were effectively neutralized—essentially annexed—then later sold cheaply by France to the U.S. That’s today’s North American Great Plains region. India and Pakistan were firmly within Britain’s sphere of influence, officially incorporated into the British Empire by the mid-19th century, not just limited to trade monopolies.

Meanwhile, Britain’s GDP was consistently at the top after China and India (and keep in mind China and India had purely agrarian economies, very different from Britain’s industrialized economy). Britain’s industrial strength led the world until the Second Industrial Revolution, when it was surpassed by the U.S. and Germany—but that was only the mainland. Remember, Britain also controlled colonies that accounted for one-fifth of the world’s land.

那仅仅是因为法国称霸欧陆，而英国从未称霸过欧陆，所以有大量剩余人口可以移民。而法国没几个人屑于去欧洲以外的地方。以北美为例，英国移民是法国十多倍，英国可以把主力放在欧洲以外，而欧陆强国从来把主力放在更值得抢的的欧洲。 这也值得神气？法国这么多年，以那么点海外投入，像隆美尔在北非玩英国人一样，长年屡屡羞辱英军，以多胜少，最终是法国在欧陆投入太多，无力支援太多而失败罢了。 法国征服过一堆的白人国家，英国征服了几个？嗯，英国征服过南非的2个微型南非白人小国，代价是一堆的以多负少的耻辱性失败，和交换比大到可笑的败仗！
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
That’s simply because France dominated continental Europe, while Britain never did—so Britain had a large surplus population available to emigrate. The French had very few people willing to go beyond Europe. Take North America as an example: British settlers outnumbered the French by more than ten to one. Britain could focus its main efforts overseas, while continental powers always concentrated their forces on Europe, the more valuable prize.

And that’s supposed to be impressive? France, with its relatively small overseas investment over the years, repeatedly humiliated British forces—like Rommel in North Africa—winning battles with fewer troops. In the end, it was just that France had invested too much in Europe and couldn’t spare enough forces overseas, so it failed.

France conquered a bunch of white nations; Britain? How many did it conquer? Well, Britain did conquer two tiny white republics in South Africa—but at the cost of a series of humiliating defeats against overwhelming odds, and absurdly uneven exchanges in battles!

神罗只是一个空壳子，实际上德意志地区常年就是割裂的，哈布斯堡王朝也没有能力统一欧洲，奥地利帝国一直就不怎么强，列强里最弱的（19世纪初欧洲五大列强，英法德俄奥，如果英国和西班牙一个水平，当年欧洲的政客都是noob吗）。奥斯曼懂点历史的没人低估它，但自从大航海开始它确实衰落了，最后成为大肥肉。伊朗上一次辉煌是否要追溯回唐朝以前的历史？还是回到古希腊时期？。最后说一句，控制海洋比控制哪一点欧陆，意义大得多，海洋有多少意义，美国19世纪的马汉的《海权论》已经说明了
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The Holy Roman Empire? Basically a hollow shell. The German lands were always fragmented. The Habsburgs never had the power to unify Europe, and the Austrian Empire? Not exactly a powerhouse—probably the weakest of the major early-19th-century players (Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Austria). And if Britain and Spain were really on the same level, were all the European politicians back then just noobs?

No one who knows history underestimates the Ottomans, but since the Age of Exploration, they were in decline—basically fat targets. And Iran? Its last real golden age—are we talking before the Tang dynasty? Or way back to Ancient Greece?

Bottom line: controlling the seas matters way more than any chunk of continental land. How important? Just read Mahan’s The Influence of Sea Power upon History—he laid it all out in the 19th century.

目前人类的历史来说英国贡献是最大的，工业革命没有哪一个发达国家不承认他的价值。法国欧洲最差的国家，去过欧洲的好多人都这样说，我也只是听别人说，我也没没去过法国，通过了解得到的一点资讯。中国人印象法国最浪漫，去过的都说谁去谁知道。印象法国人开放，去过的朋友说连乳沟都没看到过，哈哈，感情就是为了去看法国奶的。很多人说法国是欧洲素质最差的国家，这个可能看是遇到了不好的人。说欧洲法国是最排华的，这也是看遇到了什么人

In the history of humanity, Britain’s contributions are the greatest. No developed country would deny the value of the Industrial Revolution.

France? Probably the worst country in Europe. Many people who have been to Europe say so—I’m just repeating what I’ve heard; I haven’t even been to France myself, just got some information from others.

Chinese people often think France is the most romantic. Friends who have been there say, “You’ll know when you go.” People imagine the French are very open—but some friends said they didn’t even see a cleavage, haha. So apparently some people go to France just to check out French boobs.

Many say France has the lowest civility in Europe, though that probably depends on who you meet. Some claim France is the most anti-Chinese in Europe—but again, it really depends on the people you encounter.

英国不是被高估了，而是可能被低估。

不夸张得说，人类的现代文明，基本上是“英国制造”的。本人没去过英国，更不是英吹，但是英国对人类现代文明的贡献和影响之巨大，是真的值得好好研究一下的。

其实，人类文明从封建专制向现代文明转变的过程中，诸多国家都进行了颇有民族特色的尝试。在英国，在法国，在德国，在荷兰，到后来在俄国，在日本，大家结合本民族的情况进行各种尝试后，才发现英国人的那一套其实是最好的。英国的文明转型，起始于《大宪章》，在光荣革命中形成了一种深入人心的社会制度，对权力的限制和监督，对自由的捍卫，对社会规则的谨守和信仰....这种社会制度经过演变后被复制到了北美，欧洲大陆，新加坡和香港.....事实上成了不同国家社会转型时竞相模仿的模板。

某种程度上说，英国的这一套制度，是欧洲唯一取得成功的社会制度。它在不同地方会有不同的表现形式，但精神内核是一致的。法国，德国在经历社会制度的失败后，也都不自觉地从英国的制度中获得了启发，重建自己的社会制度。

当然，成功的社会制度，也在很多地方失败了。
</small>
</details>
<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Britain is not overrated—it may in fact be underrated.

It’s no exaggeration to say that modern human civilization was essentially “Made in Britain.” I’ve never been to Britain, and I’m not a fanboy, but the sheer scale of Britain’s contribution to and influence on modern civilization is something that really deserves serious study.

In the transition from feudal autocracy to modern civilization, many nations tried their own paths: Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, later Russia and Japan. After all these different attempts, it became clear that the British approach was the most effective. Britain’s transformation began with the Magna Carta and took shape with the Glorious Revolution, creating a deeply rooted social system: limits and checks on power, the defense of liberty, a respect for rules and faith in institutions. This model spread to North America, continental Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong… and became the template for other nations’ transitions.

In a sense, Britain’s system was the only European one that truly succeeded. Elsewhere it may look different on the surface, but the core spirit remains the same. Even France and Germany, after their own failed experiments, ended up drawing inspiration from the British system to rebuild their own.

Of course, even a successful system has faced plenty of failures in other places.

高估了。英国的文明开化是在法国的帮忙下完成的。英国的原住民不列颠人就是一群疯狂原始人，其生活水平就跟我国的夏朝商朝差不多。所以英国原住民被赶跑了，文化底蕴都没有了。还有英国的一些奇葩习俗真的是难以理解。

Overrated. Britain’s so-called “civilization” only happened with a lot of help from France. 🙄 The original Britons were basically a bunch of crazy savages, living at about the same level as China’s Xia or Shang dynasties. 🤷‍♂️ No wonder they got driven out and lost any real cultural foundation. And honestly, some of Britain’s bizarre customs are just beyond comprehension.

美国政治学家帕特南提出的社会资本依然很有震撼力：人类如何更有效的合作是一个长久性问题，永远没有尽头，而让政府和市民社会为了一个组织的相互利益而采取的集体行动更是难上加难，社会制度给某些社会各阶层进行合作提供了基本模式，但并非全部，至于很多人讲的地理位置，说服力也不够——即便把俄罗斯的土地和美国的土地交换，美国人依旧能在相对贫瘠的土地上创造发达的经济，一个现实的案例，以色列在强敌环伺、沙漠环境中依旧可以成为发达国家，就值得玩味



有些社会、民族、种族，由于历史积淀不够或者智慧不足，即便上帝给予“应许之地”，也依旧是一坨。好比是学渣，即便是给他安排在学霸班上，大概率也学不过学霸
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The American political scientist Robert Putnam’s concept of social capital is still incredibly striking: the question of how humans can cooperate more effectively is a long-term challenge with no end in sight. Getting governments and civil society to take collective action for mutual benefit is even harder. Social institutions provide a basic framework for cooperation among different classes, but they’re far from the whole picture. As for those who keep pointing to geography—it’s not all that convincing. Even if you swapped the land of Russia with that of the United States, Americans would still likely manage to build a developed economy on relatively barren soil. A real-world case is Israel: surrounded by enemies and stuck in desert conditions, yet still becoming a developed country. That says a lot.

Some societies, nations, or ethnic groups—due to insufficient historical accumulation or lack of wisdom—remain stagnant even if God grants them a so-called “Promised Land.” It’s like thinking you can turn a C-student into an A-student just by changing classrooms—reality doesn’t work that way.

现代工业文明就是从英国开始的，翻天了人类生产生活新篇章，也形成了对其他人类文明的降维打击，所以文明传播算是最成功的。现在美、加、澳、新都算是英国殖民地，总面积2800平方公里，殖民史上最成功的国家。和老牌帝国主义相比，中华民族伟大复兴的路还远着呢，刚迈出国门第一步。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Modern industrial civilization started in Britain. It completely transformed human production and daily life, and even dealt a “dimensionality reduction” blow to other civilizations—so in terms of spreading civilization, it was extremely successful. Today, the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all count as former British colonies, covering a total of 2.8 million square kilometers—making Britain the most successful country in colonial history. Compared with the old empires, the path to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is still long; we’ve only just taken the first step beyond our borders.

是社会制度的失败。

法国大革命后社会陷入混乱，封建复辟了好几次，没有任何稳定性。德国的那套制度各种走极端，二战打烂了，接受美国人的改造，用的还是英国人传授的制度。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
It was a failure of social institutions. 
After the French Revolution, society fell into chaos, with feudal restorations happening multiple times—there was no stability at all. Germany’s system went to extremes, got wrecked in WWII, and even after the Americans rebuilt it, they were basically following Britain’s playbook.

By your logic, how would you explain Japan invading China? Swap territories and reverse the outcome? Actually, it’s highly related to institutions.

不谈论军队、领地、领民、文化输出之类的，仅仅想评论下题目中的这句话：

工业革命早一点罢了？

一直有种误解，认为17、18世纪，人类已经走到了工业社会的门口，只是英国率先把脚踏进去了而已。没有英国，法国、俄国、西班牙、威尼斯、神罗等等都会先开启工业化大门。

确实，工业社会的所有要素都孕育在农业社会体内。但这个胎儿何时落地真的不好说。晚个两三百年都不奇怪。关心过明清中国经济的一定听说过“内卷化”，手工业者竞争失序，工资压低，消费力也随之衰竭，进而影响生产欲望以及技术革新。实际上这并不是中国特有的现象，而是一个普遍事实。同样的事情在法、德也出现了。

在1780年，即使一个法国企业家有机会学到组装珍妮纺纱机的简易方法，基本上也不具有生产价值。在印度，这么做绝对会亏损。但在英国，其年均回报率却接近40%。

而英国之所以能成为这个幸运儿，在于其较高的人力成本，丰富的煤储量，以及煤矿与主要城市及港口的超近距离。


开启的工业化不是西方，此荣誉仅属于英国。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Let’s set aside armies, territories, populations, or cultural output, and just focus on the statement in the topic:

“Industrial Revolution just happened a bit earlier?”

There’s a common misunderstanding that by the 17th and 18th centuries, humanity was already on the doorstep of an industrial society—Britain just happened to step in first. Without Britain, countries like France, Russia, Spain, Venice, the Holy Roman Empire, etc., could have led industrialization instead.

Sure, all the elements of an industrial society were incubating within agrarian societies. But when this “baby” would be born is really hard to predict—it wouldn’t be surprising if it happened two or three centuries later. Anyone who’s studied the Ming and Qing economies must have heard of “involution”: disordered competition among artisans, suppressed wages, declining consumer power, which in turn dampened production motivation and technological innovation. This wasn’t unique to China—it was a universal phenomenon. The same patterns appeared in France and Germany too.

By 1780, even if a French entrepreneur had the chance to learn a simple method to assemble a spinning jenny, it would have had virtually no production value. In India, doing so would have been a guaranteed loss. But in Britain, the annual return rate could approach 40%.

Britain’s “luck” came from relatively high labor costs, abundant coal reserves, and the extremely short distances between coal mines, major cities, and ports.

Industrialization didn’t start in the West—it started in Britain. That honor belongs solely to Britain.

It’s 2023, and honestly, China might still not be ready to kick off an Industrial Revolution—even after almost 200 years of Western influence. Playing it safe, you could even say constitutional government and the Industrial Revolution were purely English inventions. Without the Anglo-Saxons and England, you could wait 100 million years and they still might never show up.

人工费问题不敢说也许法国不行。但是后面的话，貌似多余。英国在工业革命之前也是奉行贸易保护政策的，在贸易政策方面英法并无多大区别。

I can’t speak for labor costs—maybe France wouldn’t have made it. But the rest seems kinda pointless. Even before the Industrial Revolution, Britain practiced trade protectionism, so in terms of trade policies, there wasn’t much difference between England and France.

这就见仁见智了。至少按照我引文的作者的见识，工业革命不会在那个阶段自发在法国出现。首先得承认，法国在学术上是完全有水准的。但在经济上，由于当时法国人工费比能源便宜，企业主使用新技术是亏钱的。当时法国工人手织的布，仍然可以在价格上吊打英国货。事实上全世界除了英国，所有国家（包括美帝）的工业化都是在政府护航下进行的，轻度的有关税壁垒+补贴扶持，重度的官督商办，最重度的直接上国营工业。这些国家不是出于经济动机启动工业化的，而是看重其军事价值。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
This is up for debate. At least according to the author I quoted, the Industrial Revolution wouldn’t have spontaneously happened in France at that stage. First, credit where it’s due—France was academically top-notch. But economically, labor was cheaper than energy, so using new technology would have been a loss for business owners. French workers’ handwoven cloth could still beat British goods on price.

In fact, everywhere in the world except Britain—including the U.S.—industrialization only happened under government support: light tariffs and subsidies, heavier government-supervised businesses, and at the extreme, state-run industries. These countries didn’t start industrialization out of economic motives—they did it for military value.

The British independently developed the steam engine over a hundred years, making it profitable in Britain, where labor costs were high, coal and iron were abundant, and waterways convenient. If it had relied on France, that last crucial step would probably have taken at least 500 years.

我有一个想法，就是殖民地的存在使得圈地运动中无产化的贫民可以移民，这一方面避免英国像法国一样陷入政治动荡，一方面也使得雇主更难压低工资（或许可以说是不够内卷？）。
</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
I have a thought: the existence of colonies allowed the proletarianized poor from the enclosure movement to emigrate. On one hand, this prevented Britain from falling into political turmoil like France; on the other, it made it harder for employers to push wages down—maybe you could even say it prevented over-internal competition.

得了，英国连欧洲大陆都从未也无力称霸，就这一点就秒杀了所谓英国征霸过世界。 另外，英国自己屡被欧洲小诸侯征服过。诺曼人征服英国是英国永久性的耻辱，永远未能反抗成功。永久性亡国奴。 而法国诸侯安茹也征服了英国。英国的“光荣革命”是以荷兰军队征服英国告终的。而英国呢？连苏格兰都没能征服，只能靠合伙人式的拉人入伙！ 龙虾兵强在哪？？ 法国一次反击就让美国独立了，近万英军在英国统帅率领下屈辱投降。 殖民地-----英国在北美的移民是法国十五倍，这也值得吹？ 无非是英国无力称霸欧陆，大量剩余人口可以移民罢了。 就这样，英军也败多胜少，法国像隆美尔在北非一样，用极小资源屡屡羞辱英国。最后不过是主力在欧陆决胜，没力量再投入多少去殖民地罢了，那是欧陆强国眼里的次要地区。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Come on, Britain never even had the strength to dominate continental Europe—just that alone smashes the whole “ruled the world” idea. And on top of that, Britain kept getting conquered by little European princes. The Norman Conquest? A permanent humiliation they never recovered from. Even the French Angevin princes got the better of them.

The so-called “Glorious Revolution”? Ended with a Dutch army taking over Britain. And Britain itself? Couldn’t even conquer Scotland—had to drag people into alliances just to survive.

Redcoats, really impressive? France once struck back and basically handed America its independence, forcing nearly 10,000 British troops to surrender under British command.

As for colonies—British settlers in North America outnumbered the French fifteen to one. Big deal? Not really. It’s just that Britain couldn’t dominate Europe, so all that extra population had to emigrate.

Even then, the British army lost more often than it won. France, like Rommel in North Africa, repeatedly humiliated Britain with tiny forces. In the end, continental powers kept their main forces in Europe and barely bothered with overseas colonies—which were just side projects from their perspective.

By World War I and II, Britain had already fallen from its pedestal—that’s why Germany dared to challenge it. Germany lost in WWII mainly because of the US and USSR.

Now Britain’s just a troublemaker 😆, America’s top sidekick.

文明灯塔的称号名至实归。

英国地位最重要的就是他们的思维方式：海洋文明的思维方式。

1.尊重事实。用我们的话说叫实事求是。海运因为瞎吹牛皮出海容易出岔子淹死，必须实在。

2.演绎理性的保守思维。尊重传统，灵机一动挂的概率太高。

3.契约守信。商业文明不守信混不下去。

政治统治思维就是保守守信维护法律，少干预社会经济，不折腾。

然后让我们看一下这个思维的事实上的结果。

1.大宪章，王在法下。法治社会，君主立宪制。（权力制度的明确）

2.宗教改革，基督教新教加尔文派，也称清教徒。（社会财富的积累）

3.剑桥大学（不知道是不是第一所大学，科学转化为应用技术）

4.代议制，无代表不纳税。（权利与义务的统一）

5.公务员财产公示制度。（公平透明接受监督）

6.国富论，自由市场。（以人性之私行善服务社会）

7.工业革命。

工业革命只是我们看到的成功的显化和结果。

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The title “Beacon of Civilization” is well-deserved.

Britain’s key strength lies in their mindset: the maritime civilization mindset.

Respect for facts. As we say, “seek truth from facts.” You can’t bluff your way on the sea—one mistake and you drown.

Deductive, rational conservatism. Respect traditions—spur-of-the-moment decisions are too risky.

Keeping promises. You can’t survive in a commercial civilization if you break contracts.

Their political mindset? Conservative, law-abiding, minimal interference in the economy—no unnecessary chaos.

Now let’s look at what this mindset actually produced:

Magna Carta, kings under the law—rule of law, constitutional monarchy (clear power structures).

Reformation: Protestant Calvinism, aka Puritans (accumulation of social wealth).

Cambridge University (turning science into applied technology).

Representative system: no taxation without representation (unifying rights and duties).

Public disclosure of civil servants’ assets (fairness, transparency, accountability).

The Wealth of Nations, free market (human self-interest serving society).

Industrial Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution is just the visible result—the tangible success—of all this.

“Sun never sets on the British Empire”? You must be joking… With 34 million km² of colonies, wherever the British ruled, the sun was always up—hence the phrase.

…Cambridge University itself is the origin of modern science and engineering education… The Times has centuries of history, and even Japan’s Yomiuri Shimbun, which became the world’s second-largest newspaper by circulation, was modeled after learning from Britain.🤔

To some extent, it’s more accurate to say that the English-speaking world, rather than “the West” in general, became developed. Most developed countries founded by European settlers are English-speaking (South Africa—Afrikaans counts partially, Argentina partially, Quebec partially).

It’s more accurate to say that Germany and France became developed largely because they were close to the UK and shared similar cultural roots—like close siblings basking in the “holy light.” Only Britain’s nearest relatives—its “brother” Europe and “sons” like the U.S., Australia—became fully developed; more distant “relatives’ children” lagged behind.

</small>
</details>

<div style="color: #0077b8;">
Exactly. Many other countries’ colonies didn’t develop nearly as successfully. Britain’s colonies—like the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—benefited from the institutional, legal, and economic frameworks imported from the UK, which helped them grow into prosperous societies. In contrast, colonies of other European powers often lacked the same combination of stability, institutions, and incentives for long-term development.

英国殖民那么多地方，请问现在哪些地方天天恨得英国咬牙切齿的？

反过来我们国家，号称以德服人。几千年受我们文化影响的周边国家，日韩越，请问对我们什么态度？
</small>
</details>
<div style="color: #0077b8;">
The British colonized so many places—so tell me, which of them are still gnashing their teeth at Britain every single day?

On the other hand, our country claims to “govern by virtue.” After thousands of years of cultural influence on neighboring countries like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, what kind of attitude do they actually have toward us?

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
While it’s true that some former British colonies may no longer harbor daily resentment, it’s naive to overlook the long-term social, economic, and cultural impacts of British colonial rule. For example:
</br></br>
In India and Pakistan, the borders drawn during the Partition in 1947 led to massive displacement and ongoing territorial disputes like Kashmir.
</br></br>
In Nigeria, the arbitrary borders created by the British amalgamation of diverse ethnic groups still contribute to ethnic tensions and periodic violence.
</br></br>
In Kenya, land policies under British colonial rule displaced local populations and concentrated land ownership, effects of which are still visible today.
</br></br>
In Hong Kong, the legal and economic systems reflect British colonial legacy, which shaped current social tensions and governance debates.
</br></br>
The absence of constant visible anger doesn’t erase the historical consequences or the injustices inflicted.
</br></br>
At the same time, it’s undeniable that Britain has made enormous contributions to global civilization—advances in science, industry, law, and political thought have had a lasting positive impact worldwide. Overall, Britain remains a great and historically influential country."
