In recent years, under the influence of domestic news coverage, the United States no longer appears as glamorous as it once did in my memory. From the wars it initiated in various countries, to the trade war it launched against China last year, and more recently its attitude toward the pandemic and toward China amid global panic (news reports say the U.S. promised $100 million in aid to support China’s fight against the outbreak, but the whereabouts of that money remain unclear)—all of these raise questions.

What kind of country is the United States, really? Do the lives of people living in America look the same as the America we see through our media? As the world’s number one power, are some of its actions toward other countries inconsistent with the sense of responsibility it should uphold? And where is America headed in the future?

刚到美国的时候，觉得美国人像傻子一样，到处都是漏洞。任何地方的厕所都有免费纸，有些人定期去扯很多回家，纸都不用买。快餐店的饮料，有的可以无限续杯，有些几个人买一份饮料，接回来灌到各自的杯子里；等等。

去美国，是我第一次看见一个外卖员带着氧气瓶送披萨，他喘着气说：“医生说我该躺着，但我得先还掉这周的车贷。”

这个故事发生在密歇根州的一个下雪天。路很滑，气温零下十几度，我等着Airbnb送的晚餐，结果门外来的是一个戴着氧气鼻管的中年男人。

他车窗摇不下来，吃力地把披萨递进来，然后笑了一下，说：“小费随意，祝你周末愉快。”

我愣了两秒。他喘得厉害，边说话边咳。我问他还好不。他挥了挥手：

“我本来应该住院的，但我得先还掉我那台雪佛兰的贷款，再躺。”

这一刻我突然意识到：这就是“体面的穷”——不是烂，不是逃，而是明知道不行了，还得站着把最后一顿饭送完。
01. 以为美国穷人像电影里那样流浪，现实是：他们戴着工牌、穿着制服、很安静地忙着生存

“穷人”在美国，不是你在地铁口看到的那种破衣烂衫，而是：

- 连上两班超市夜班的单亲妈妈
- 白天在学校送货、晚上当Uber司机的退伍军人
- 把房车停在沃尔玛停车场过夜的仓库装卸工
- 开着20年前丰田、把所有修车记录贴在方向盘上的快递员
- 他们穿得不差，说话有礼，信用卡能刷但不一定能还。

每个人都维持着最低限度的体面——因为崩是不能崩的，一崩就可能掉进完全爬不出的深坑。

02. 这地方没有“及时行乐”，只有“延迟还债”

你走进美国郊区的廉价加油站，收银员看起来像大学生，戴着AirPods，还在背单词。你可能会想：“好励志啊。”

但你多问几句，就知道：他读不起大学，在靠自学考“成人学历”；爸妈都在工作，家里有三个孩子；他不能失业，不然全家连医保都没了。

所谓“自由美国”，对这些人来说，是——“我可以选择在加油站打工，还是麦当劳打工”。

不是他们不想换生活，是根本没资本换。

他们买的车不能坏，住的房不能涨租，看不起病、请不起假，手机分期付款、衣服用EBT代金券，牙断了只能吃流食，去不了医院，但不能不去上班。

这就是“活着”的底线：先维持体面，再试着喘气。

03. 夜班，是美国底层最大的隐形拼图

我在克利夫兰的一家便利店里，凌晨三点买水。

一个黑人女生正在上夜班，笑得很甜。我问她几点下班，她说：“早上七点。”

“然后你回家休息？”

“不是，我去帮我妈带孩子，顺便打份中午的兼职。”

我说：“你一天几个小时是你的？”

她愣了一下：“三个吧？有时候四个。”

我说：“你还笑得出来？”

她说：“我不能不笑，我如果不笑，顾客会投诉我态度差，我就得写报告。”

在美国越往夜里走，越会发现：这国家表面上是“发达世界”，但底层运转系统，全靠一群困着但不能停的人，撑着不掉线

04. 医保是“富人的法术”，穷人连生病的资格都没有

在美国，很多穷人不是不想看病，是——看病的代价比病本身还致命。

发烧，可以去急诊，但账单可能比你三个月工资还多；牙疼，可以拔牙，但没有牙医保险，那颗牙会拔掉你的尊严。

想心理咨询？笑话，咨询一次等于一周伙食费。

我问一个夜班便利店员工：“你们公司给医保吗？”

他说：“给一半，但要我工时达到每周35小时。”

“你有达到吗？”

“没有。我每周被安排34小时。”

这就是美国——不给你摁死，但也不给你活太顺。

05. 真正的互助是街坊之间的“小默契”

我住在一个小镇的边缘区，一周下来发现：真正能彼此托底的，不是美国警察，不是社保，而是“左邻右舍的那句你还好吗”。

超市大妈每天下班会顺路送无车邻居一段路
餐厅打包的剩饭会放在镇上的“小冰箱屋”，谁需要就拿
家里失火的人，邻居会自发组队刷墙重建
这种“我们彼此都不富，但谁也不能倒下”的人情逻辑，撑起了美国很多看起来“没崩”的地方。

他们活得苦，但不自卑。没有哪个人会因为自己穷而低头，他们会说：

“Yes, I’m broke, but I’m not broken.”

06. “自由”是写在宪法上的，生活是压在账单下的

你问底层美国人：“你觉得自己自由吗？”

很多人会说：“我可以说话、可以罢工、可以游行。”

但接下来补一句：“可我说了没人听，罢工要扣工资，游行完我得加班补回来。”

美国从不否认你“有选择权”，但从来不给你“可选项”。

你可以不上夜班——但就失去医保；不送外卖——就断了收入；不打三份工——但就交不起学费。

这是一个不给你铁笼子，但处处都在绷紧你的皮筋的地方。

07. 美国底层的交通，是“没车等于断腿，有车等于断存款”

走进美国郊区的小镇，最先感到焦虑的不是语言，而是——没有车。

公交？一天两班，不在时间点上别指望它；

地铁？只存在于几个大城市，而且晚上千万别坐；

拼车？太贵，Uber拉一次比你一小时工资还多。

对底层美国人来说，车不是生活方式，是生存工具。

但拥有一辆车，成本远比想的高：

每月贷款 + 保险 + 油费，加起来可能比房租还贵
一次小剐蹭，维修起步500美元，保险还涨价
没人帮你修、没人搭你便车，全靠自己修自己抠自己补
有个仓库打工的黑人兄弟告诉我：

“我的车在我失业那天抛锚，我第一件事不是找工作，是修车。”

他最后用了信用卡现金分期修完，三个月没吃快餐。

08. 快餐不是饮食选择，是贫穷人生的“速度补丁”

麦当劳、塔可钟、Wendy’s、汉堡王……在美国任何一条商业街都能看到这些快餐品牌。

但别误会，这不是“消费自由”的象征，而是——“我只剩这点时间和预算了。”

一个上夜班的便利店店员，一天三顿全靠麦当劳套餐撑；

一位打两份工的女工告诉我：“5块钱的Wendy’s组合是我唯一能预测的幸福。”

还有人说：“我吃塔可钟，不是因为好吃，是因为不吃就迟到了。”

快餐在美国底层生活中，是“疲惫与饥饿之间的缝合剂”。

你吃下去的不是汉堡，而是“这顿解决了，我还能撑下去”的短暂踏实。

09｜节日越热闹，底层美国人越安静

可能以为感恩节、圣诞节、独立日这种节日是美国最热闹的时刻。

没错，是热闹——对中产以上的人而言。


但对底层人来说，这些节日意味着：

没加班机会了，收入少了一截
家里没钱聚餐，只能装作不饿
超市都涨价了，吃顿火鸡要精算到分
路上全是车，你不能接单送货
我在一家Dollar Tree店门口看到一个老头坐着抽烟，穿着泛白的圣诞毛衣。他看着店里红绿灯泡笑着说：

“我老婆几年前去世了，她最喜欢圣诞。现在我只是看，不过节。”

节日不是不重要，是“对很多人来说，太贵了”。

结尾

美国底层人不是活得惨，是活得太稳了，稳得你都忘了他们一直在硬撑。

他们穿着工装笑着打工，不吵不闹不崩溃；在清晨的公交站、凌晨的洗衣店、晚上的快餐店里循环着；

他们不是“美国梦”的主角，但是这梦还能撑住的原因。

<div class="translated-text">

When I first arrived in the United States, I thought Americans were a bit naïve, and that there were loopholes everywhere. Every public restroom had free toilet paper—some people would even take rolls home regularly, never having to buy any. In fast-food restaurants, drinks were sometimes refillable without limit; a few people would buy just one drink, then refill it and pour it into their friends’ cups.  

But then I encountered something that changed my perspective.  

It was the first time I saw a deliveryman bring pizza while carrying an oxygen tank. He was out of breath and said: *“The doctor told me I should be in bed, but I have to pay off this week’s car loan first.”*  

This happened on a snowy day in Michigan. The roads were slippery, temperatures below freezing. I was waiting for my Airbnb dinner delivery when a middle-aged man with an oxygen tube at his nose showed up at the door.  

He couldn’t roll down his car window, so he handed me the pizza with great effort, then managed a smile: *“Tip is up to you. Have a nice weekend.”*  

I froze for two seconds. He was breathing heavily, coughing between words. I asked if he was okay. He waved his hand and said:  

*“I should be in the hospital. But I need to finish paying off my Chevy before I can lie down.”*  

At that moment, I suddenly realized what “dignified poverty” meant—not collapsing, not running away, but knowing you are at your limit and still delivering that last meal standing.  

![](images/2025/America-part1-01.webp (Poverty in America Isn’t Like the Movies))

**01. Poverty in America Isn’t Like the Movies** 

I used to imagine American poverty as homeless people wandering the streets in ragged clothes. In reality, the poor in America wear uniforms, ID badges, and quietly keep working:  

- A single mother working two consecutive night shifts at a supermarket  
- A veteran delivering packages during the day and driving Uber at night  
- A warehouse worker sleeping in an RV parked overnight at Walmart  
- A courier driving a 20-year-old Toyota, taping every repair receipt onto the steering wheel  

They don’t always look shabby. They’re polite, swipe credit cards they may not be able to repay, and maintain just enough dignity—because once dignity collapses, they may fall into a hole they can never climb out of.  

![](images/2025/America-part1-02.webp (Here, There’s No “Carpe Diem,” Only “Deferred Debt))

**02. Here, There’s No “Carpe Diem,” Only “Deferred Debt”** 

Walk into a cheap gas station in the suburbs, and the cashier might look like a college student, wearing AirPods and memorizing vocabulary. At first you might think: *“So inspiring!”*  

But ask a few more questions and you’ll find out: he can’t afford college, so he’s studying for an “adult diploma” on his own. His parents both work, and he has three siblings at home. He can’t afford to lose this job—otherwise, the whole family would lose health insurance.  

So-called “freedom” in America, for people like him, means: *“I can choose whether to work at the gas station or at McDonald’s.”*  

It’s not that they don’t want to change their lives—it’s that they don’t have the capital to do so.  

Their cars cannot break down. Their rent cannot go up. They cannot afford to get sick, cannot afford to take leave. Their phones are on installment plans, their clothes paid with EBT vouchers (government food assistance), their broken teeth left untreated because they can’t pay the dentist. They still have to go to work the next day.  

The bottom line of survival is simple: maintain dignity first, then try to catch your breath.  


![](images/2025/America-part1-03.webp (Night Shifts: The Hidden Puzzle Piece of the American Underclass))

**03. Night Shifts: The Hidden Puzzle Piece of the American Underclass**

At 3 a.m., I bought water in a convenience store in Cleveland.  

A young Black woman was working the night shift, smiling sweetly. I asked when her shift ended. She said: *“7 a.m.”*  

*“And then you go home and rest?”*  

*“No, I go help my mom with the kids, and then work a part-time job at noon.”*  

*“How many hours a day are just for yourself?”*  

She paused, thought, and said: *“Three… sometimes four.”*  

*“And you can still smile?”*  

She answered: *“I have to. If I don’t smile, customers complain about my attitude. Then I’d have to write a report.”*  

The later into the night you go in America, the more you realize: the country may look like the “developed world” on the surface, but its hidden operating system relies on countless people trapped in exhaustion, unable to stop, yet still holding things together.  

![](images/2025/America-part1-04.webp (Health Insurance: A Spell for the Rich))

**04. Health Insurance: A Spell for the Rich**

In America, many poor people don’t avoid doctors because they don’t want treatment—it’s because the cost of treatment can be more fatal than the illness itself.  

A fever? You can go to the ER, but the bill may cost three months’ salary.  
A toothache? You can have it pulled, but without dental insurance, that tooth may take your dignity with it.  
Mental health counseling? A joke—one session costs a week’s worth of groceries.  

I asked a convenience store night-shift worker: *“Does your company provide health insurance?”*  
He said: *“Half of it—if I reach 35 working hours a week.”*  

*“And do you?”*  

*“No. They always schedule me 34 hours.”*  

That’s America: it doesn’t crush you completely, but it never lets you live too comfortably either.  


![](images/2025/America-part1-05.webp (Real Mutual Aid Lives in Neighborhoods))

**05. Real Mutual Aid Lives in Neighborhoods**

I stayed in the outskirts of a small town for a week and discovered: real safety nets aren’t the police, nor social security—they are neighbors quietly looking out for one another.  

- A supermarket clerk gives rides home to coworkers without cars.  
- Restaurant leftovers are placed in a “community fridge” for anyone who needs them.  
- When someone’s house burns down, neighbors gather to repaint and rebuild it.  

This unspoken logic—*“We’re all poor, but no one can collapse”*—is what keeps many fragile American communities from breaking apart.  

They live hard lives, but without shame. No one bows their head simply for being broke. They say proudly:  

*“Yes, I’m broke, but I’m not broken.”*  

*(Translator’s note: Dollar Tree mentioned earlier is a U.S. dollar-store chain where most items cost about $1.)*  


![](images/2025/America-part1-06.webp (Freedom Written in the Constitution, Life Buried Under Bills))

**06. Freedom Written in the Constitution, Life Buried Under Bills**

Ask working-class Americans: *“Do you feel free?”*  

Many will say: *“Yes, I can speak, I can strike, I can march.”*  
Then they’ll add: *“But no one listens. A strike means lost wages. After marching, I have to work overtime to make it up.”*  

America never denies you *the right to choose*—but it rarely gives you any *real options*.  

You can quit your night shift—but lose your health insurance.  
You can stop delivering food—but your income is gone.  
You can refuse to work three jobs—but then you can’t pay tuition.  

This is a place that doesn’t put you in an iron cage, but tightens every rubber band around you until you can barely breathe.  

![](images/2025/America-part1-07.webp (Transportation: No Car, No Legs; With Car, No Savings))

**07. Transportation: No Car, No Legs; With Car, No Savings**

In small-town America, the first anxiety is not language, but transportation. Without a car, you’re stranded.  

Buses? Two a day—miss the schedule, and forget it.  
Subways? Only in big cities, and don’t ride them at night.  
Ridesharing? Too expensive—an Uber ride costs more than an hour’s wage.  

For working-class Americans, a car isn’t a lifestyle—it’s survival. But owning one is costly:  

- Monthly loan + insurance + gas can exceed rent.  
- A minor fender-bender means at least $500 in repairs, plus higher insurance rates.  
- No one will lend you a ride—you patch it up yourself, or not at all.  

A warehouse worker told me: *“When my car broke down the day I lost my job, the first thing I did wasn’t finding work. It was fixing the car.”*  

He paid with a cash advance on his credit card, then survived three months without fast food.  


![](images/2025/America-part1-08.webp (Fast Food Isn’t a Choice, It’s a Poverty Shortcut))

**08. Fast Food Isn’t a Choice, It’s a Poverty Shortcut**

McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Wendy’s, Burger King—you see them on every commercial street.  

But don’t mistake that for consumer freedom. It really means: *“This is all I can afford in time and money.”*  

- A night-shift clerk eats McDonald’s for all three meals.  
- A woman working two jobs says: *“A $5 Wendy’s combo is my only predictable happiness.”*  
- Another worker says: *“I eat Taco Bell, not because it tastes good, but because if I don’t, I’ll be late.”*  

Fast food isn’t food—it’s a “patch” between exhaustion and hunger. You’re not eating a burger; you’re swallowing the thought: *“I can keep going for one more day.”*  

![](images/2025/America-part1-09.webp (The Louder the Holiday, the Quieter the Poor))

**09. The Louder the Holiday, the Quieter the Poor**

You might think Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Independence Day are America’s liveliest times. And they are—if you’re middle class or above.  

For the poor, holidays mean:  

- No overtime, so less income  
- No money for a family feast, so pretending not to be hungry  
- Price hikes at supermarkets, making a turkey an expensive luxury  
- Roads full of traffic, meaning no delivery orders  

Outside a Dollar Tree store, I saw an old man smoking, wearing a faded Christmas sweater. He looked at the red and green lights inside and smiled:  

*“My wife passed away a few years ago. She loved Christmas. Now I just watch—I don’t celebrate.”*  

Holidays aren’t unimportant. They’re just *too expensive* for many.  


**Conclusion**

The American underclass doesn’t live miserably—they live **too steadily**. So steady that you forget they’ve been holding on, barely.  

They wear uniforms, smile while working, never shouting, never collapsing. They rotate endlessly through bus stops at dawn, laundromats at midnight, and fast-food counters in the evening.  

They are not the protagonists of the “American Dream”—but they are the reason this dream still stands.

半真半假的文章，说的是真话，但营造出的感觉好奇怪，或者是真话不全说，
普通人收入低是真的，那收入到底有多低？他每个小时的工资是多少？每周工作多少个小时？，
美国公共交通不方便也是真的，全世界公共交通其实都不方便，到了郊区就得靠自行车，有点钱搞辆摩托，你一定要开车，开车成本可就高了，
快餐厅对于底层人来说比较实在，无非是因为快餐厅的价格并没有那么那么的高，把时间花在自己做菜上，和在快餐厅里面买一个汉堡，你会发现，其实快餐厅的性价比比较高
但通过他的描写，变成了穷人非常非常的忙，忙到了已经没时间做饭的时候，就感觉怪怪的，一方面说美国人懒，现在又变成了美国穷人，一天要干12个小时的感觉
现在都换赛道了吗？
我们按照美国最低工资，然后乘以12个小时再乘以六天，他的工资还是可以的，
这么勤劳的美国人可不多呀，真要这样的话，老美的制造业也不会垮成这个样子，
媒体一方面告诉我们，在美国想要找一个不吸毒的，朝九晚五打螺丝的人都找不到，一方面又告诉我美国人要干12个小时，忙到没有时间，自己做饭，
所以不要相信嘴上说什么，要相信钱去哪里了，腿往哪里跑
典型的就是都说北京上海不好，家乡比大城市好多了，但是腿却都往大城市跑，

Half-Truths and Mixed Narratives

Some articles tell the truth, but the way they frame it feels strange—half true, half misleading.

It’s true that ordinary people’s incomes are low in the U.S. But how low, exactly? What’s their hourly wage? How many hours do they actually work per week?

It’s also true that public transportation in America is inconvenient. But to be fair, public transit is inconvenient in most parts of the world—once you’re in the suburbs, you’ll likely need a bicycle, and if you have a bit more money, maybe a motorcycle. Eventually, you really need a car, and the cost of owning one is high.

Fast food is indeed practical for low-income groups, not because they’re “too busy to cook,” but because the price isn’t that high. If you compare the time and cost of cooking at home with just buying a burger at a fast-food place, you’ll find the cost-performance ratio of fast food is actually quite good.

But the way some writers describe it, it becomes: poor people are so busy that they literally don’t have time to cook. That feels off. On the one hand, we’re told Americans are lazy. On the other hand, we’re told poor Americans work 12 hours a day and are too exhausted to cook. So… did the narrative suddenly switch lanes?

Let’s do the math: if someone works 12 hours a day, six days a week, even at the U.S. federal minimum wage, their income is still “okay” by basic standards. Honestly, not many Americans are that hardworking. If they really were, America’s manufacturing industry wouldn’t have collapsed the way it did.

Media also tells us: it’s hard to find a sober, nine-to-five factory worker in the U.S. today. Yet at the same time, we’re told Americans are working 12-hour days, too busy to even cook. The contradictions are obvious.

That’s why you shouldn’t just believe what people say—you need to look at where the money flows and where people’s feet go.

Take China as an example: many people complain that Beijing and Shanghai are terrible places to live, and say their hometowns are much better. But when it comes to real choices, their feet carry them straight to the big cities.

真的很，我在那儿留学毕业后，还呆了几年，待不下去。一个是收入一般，其次福利很差，治安不好，通勤很费时间和油，晚上几乎没有娱乐，周末娱乐很贵。总之就是能活着，但是很苦闷。在西雅图。回到老家，虽然没有那么多高楼大厦，但是想要的东西应有尽有（网购）想吃的东西也基本应有尽有（吃这方面不说，比在美国时候好十倍）。娱乐偶尔还是能去去酒吧和ktv放松下的，至于你说私人会所什么的。在中美两国都不是普通老百姓能去的。旅游的话一年三两次吧

Honestly, I studied abroad in the U.S., graduated, and stayed there for a few more years—but in the end, I just couldn’t keep living there. The income was average, welfare was poor, public safety wasn’t great, commuting cost both time and gas, nightlife was almost nonexistent, and weekend entertainment was expensive. In short, you could survive, but life felt dull and frustrating. This was in Seattle.

After coming back to my hometown, life actually felt much better. There may not be as many skyscrapers, but thanks to online shopping, you can get almost everything you want. Food, especially, is far better than in the U.S.—ten times better, I’d say. For entertainment, you can still go to a bar or KTV once in a while to relax. As for private clubs, they’re not really for ordinary people in either China or the U.S. As for travel, I can manage two or three trips a year.

两班倒在那边是指两个7小时，或者8+6兼职吧，而且是服务业的兼职，不是工业的，工业的需要工作更长时间的全职工。
两班之间跨街区通勤导致的没时间回家吃饭，快餐肯定比回去捣鼓白人饭方便
服务业摸鱼时间比工业多，想偷懒肯定选服务业，这个和缺少良家工人+用共工成本高导致的制造业拉胯并不矛盾
钱往钱多的地方跑，美国金融业天下第一，当然往美国跑，但金融业强不代表普通人生活好
总体上逻辑是有依据的
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
In the U.S., working two shifts usually means two 7-hour stints, or sometimes an 8-hour shift plus a 6-hour part-time job. These are typically service jobs, not industrial work. Industrial jobs often require longer hours and are usually full-time.

The “no time to cook” problem often comes from commuting between shifts across neighborhoods. In that case, grabbing fast food is obviously more convenient than going all the way home to prepare a basic meal.

Compared with industrial work, service jobs allow more downtime and “slack.” If someone wants to take it easy, they are more likely to choose service-sector work. This doesn’t contradict the decline of U.S. manufacturing, which is largely due to a shortage of reliable workers combined with high labor costs.

Money always flows to where there’s more of it. America’s financial sector is the strongest in the world, so of course people are drawn there. But having a powerful financial industry doesn’t necessarily mean ordinary people enjoy a good standard of living.

Overall, the logic still has a basis.

It feels like they’re glorifying the act of desperately flailing in the water just to keep from sinking, and calling it “maintaining dignity.” Personally, I used to think of “dignity” more like in Titanic—when people calmly straightened their clothes and faced the end with composure before the ship went down. 😆

There’s a guy in the U.S. working as a dishwasher who often uploads videos on Bilibili. He frequently gets hate comments. Why? Because even as a dishwasher, he has weekends off, makes over 3,000 USD a month, and was able to buy a laptop with just three weeks of wages—a laptop that costs 20,000 RMB back in China.

The criticism goes: “How dare a mere dishwasher earn more than me, live in America, and even show it off online? Disgusting.”

现在美国刷盘子要能挣3000美金，有点困难了，西班牙裔的南美移民实在是太能干活了，

Nowadays, it’s quite difficult to earn $3,000 a month just by washing dishes in the U.S. The Hispanic and Latin American immigrants are simply too hardworking.

At the same time, fewer and fewer Chinese immigrants are willing to stick to honest dishwasher jobs. More and more are moving into gray-area or underground work.

美国底层不是收入低，毕竟2000美元实际购买力用于正常生存也完全够了，而是每月的固定开支太多了，扣完后剩的钱就只能勉强生存了，论实际的生活质量真的不一定比流浪汉强，这个是最魔幻的

The working-class in the U.S. isn’t really low-income—after all, $2,000 a month has enough purchasing power for basic survival. The problem is the sheer amount of fixed monthly expenses. After paying rent, insurance, utilities, and other necessities, there’s barely anything left, leaving people just scraping by. In terms of actual living standards, they aren’t necessarily better off than the homeless. That’s the truly surreal part.

中国的公共交通在全世界排名非常领先，它得益于我国对公共交通的大额的财政补贴以及处在社会转型期，还有大量的人依赖公共交通出行，但随着时间的变化，广大群众将会得到人手一辆电瓶车或者汽车，到时候公共交通的发达程度会下降，

比如从农村去县城的公交班次会降低甚至停运，因为人人家里有了电瓶车车，，公交线路没有足够的人口来乘坐，如果又没有巨额的财政补贴，这样的线路就会停掉
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Public transportation in China ranks among the best in the world. This is largely thanks to significant government subsidies, the country’s social transition period, and the fact that a large portion of the population relies on public transit for daily travel.

However, over time, as more people acquire electric bikes or cars, the relative importance and usage of public transit may decline. For example, bus services from rural areas to county towns may be reduced or even discontinued, because with everyone owning an electric bike or vehicle, there aren’t enough passengers to sustain the routes. Unless there are massive government subsidies, such lines are likely to be shut down.

Based on what my distant relatives and classmates in the U.S. say, here’s what puzzles them most: people without proper legal status (no “household registration” or green card) have almost no social protection, while those who do have it could easily find relatively well-paying jobs that aren’t too exhausting—yet they often choose to slack off or work informal “under-the-table” gigs.

Then there’s ordinary people’s spending habits. With careful budgeting, they could scrape by and even occasionally afford some treats. But either they spend recklessly without planning, forcing themselves to take two jobs, or they shirk work entirely, chasing informal or even illegal activities.

As a result, local Americans often find their jobs mostly taken over by immigrants from South Asia, Latin America, and Mexico.

The social structures of the two countries are different. China has a pyramid-shaped structure: when people talk about the struggles of the lower class, more than half of Chinese people can relate, because many feel they themselves are at the bottom.

The U.S., on the other hand, has a “date pit” (narrow center, fatter top and bottom) structure. In reality, the lower class isn’t as large as many Chinese people imagine.

你都说走线了，那些人就是美国不需要的废物，符合美国需要条件的是可以合法过去的。之前走eb5投资签证过去，50万美元投资+创造10个/年工作岗位的条件，从1990年有这东西开始，34年时间只审批通过了11万人，特朗普要收500万美元的金卡可是免审核的，80亿地球人里有钱买这张卡的只有不到五百万人，且其中大部分已经是美国人
</small>

<div class="translated-text">
As you said, those who take the undocumented route are mostly people the U.S. doesn’t really need. Those who meet the official criteria can immigrate legally.

Take the EB-5 investor visa, for example: a $500,000 investment plus the creation of 10 jobs per year. Since its introduction in 1990, only about 110,000 people have been approved in 34 years.

Trump’s proposed $5 million “gold card” bypasses the usual scrutiny, but out of 8 billion people on Earth, fewer than 5 million could actually afford it—and most of them are already U.S. citizens.

美国人觉得中国人太有钱了，因为中国旅游的人去了就是买买买，他们不知道的是一般中国人很少出国，出去一次当然得买一些国内买不到的或者国内卖的贵的商品；另外一个原因是帮别人带货，帮别人买花的不知自己的钱，也是可以装大款得。 如人饮水，冷暖自知，有钱人有能力的人到哪里都差不到哪的，普通人在任何社会里都只能活得普通。 当然普通是相对的，比如90年代中国普通人到了美国，就更普通了，在美国的阶层划分里就下了一个档次，但他用在美国赚到的钱再在中国的阶层划分里会有比较优势。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Americans often think Chinese tourists are super rich because they go abroad and just buy, buy, buy. What they don’t realize is that most Chinese rarely travel overseas; when they do, they naturally buy things that are hard to find in China or are more expensive there. Another reason is buying for others—helping friends or family shop—so the money spent isn’t entirely their own, but it still looks like they’re spending lavishly.

As the saying goes, only the person drinking the water knows its temperature—wealth and capability follow the person. Those who have means can maintain their status anywhere, while ordinary people are always, well, ordinary in any society.

Of course, “ordinary” is relative. For example, an average Chinese person in the ’90s would be lower on the social ladder in the U.S., but the money they earned there could give them a comparative advantage back in China.

Used cars in the U.S. aren’t actually expensive. Take the car the protagonist bought in Transformers 1 as an example. BMWs in the U.S. are much cheaper than in China, especially second-hand ones—you can get a pretty decent used BMW for around $20,000.

But since repairs are expensive, it’s best if you know how to fix cars yourself. You see this all the time in American TV shows, which is pretty realistic.

Americans do tend to spend money freely, and many are heavily in debt, living paycheck to paycheck 🤔.

Some are rich—after all, being wealthy in the U.S. is really nice.
Some just can’t make it in China and think maybe they can make it in America.
And some… are just plain dumb.

America’s in such a rough spot, yet so many people are still desperate to immigrate 🤦‍♂️. The American Dream isn’t about getting ahead—it’s about giving everyone a chance to reflect on the meaning of their own life.

I couldn’t get past half of it. Do you know why they call it a “developed country”? Because even the poorest people there pay way more than the poorest people here. 👋 They think living in a small apartment is “chill” (meaning—they’re still poor). Don’t deny it, they’re poor, poor.

Health insurance? What’s that? Such a fancy thing, now you’re not even entitled to it 👋. You think having insurance means you’re worry-free? That it costs less? Not at all 👋. The actual cost is $10,000, but because you have insurance, they charge $100,000—they make more either way 👋. What I mean is, no matter what method, they earn the same money—they just play it differently. You think paying insurance fees guarantees future coverage? In the end, your money just covers someone else’s bills, the hospital never loses and actually profits more. Do you really need to rely on reimbursements every day?

And the poor kids—some get less than a dollar of pocket money a day. Can you even imagine that? The surface doesn’t tell the whole story. Poor, poor, poor—there are still very poor places out there. Foreign countries aren’t necessarily perfect, but at least they’re developed in the sense that they don’t ignore you just because you can’t afford food. As for us? We’re behind—they’re better than us, and we still have some catching up to do.

和吃苦没关系，能打三份工还去卖血就不可能不勤劳，举个不是特别恰当的例子，只需要明白大概意思那种：假如一个普通人，月薪2000美元，按照美元的购买力，他一定可以很轻松的满足基本生存，但要是这个人每月还得扣1500美元的各种固定开支呢？还剩下500美元就只够勉强生存了。美国大概就是这样子，每月的固定开支太多了，所以在美国收入能够超过那些固定开支的钱才算钱，不像中国，你月薪3000就是能有3000块钱的消费力
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
It’s not about work ethic—anyone working three jobs and even selling blood is definitely hardworking. Here’s a rough example: suppose an ordinary person earns $2,000 a month. With the purchasing power of the dollar, that would easily cover basic living needs. But if this person has $1,500 in fixed monthly expenses, only $500 is left—barely enough to get by. This is roughly how it works in the U.S.: monthly fixed costs are so high that only the money left after covering them really counts. Unlike China, where a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan translates directly into 3,000 yuan of actual spending power.

There’s no annual vehicle inspection in the U.S., and motorcycles don’t get scrapped after 13 years. This article honestly reflects the real cost of living there.

> <font color="#0077b8">Translator’s Note</font>  
> In China, vehicles are required to undergo an annual inspection (known as the Motor Vehicle Safety and Emission Inspection) after a certain number of years or mileage. The inspection ensures that the vehicle meets road safety and emissions standards.  
> 
> **Key points:** 
> 
> **Timing:**
> 
> - New cars are generally exempt from inspection for the first three years (depending on vehicle type and local regulations).
> - Cars over three years old usually require annual or biennial inspections.
> - Larger or commercial vehicles have shorter inspection cycles.
> 
> **Inspection Content:**
> 
> - Safety systems such as brakes, steering, lights, and seat belts.
> - Emissions testing to ensure pollution control.
> - Vehicle appearance and registration compliance.
> 
> **Purpose:**
> 
> - Enhance road safety and reduce accidents.
> - Control vehicle emissions and protect the environment.
> 
> **Consequences of Failing Inspection:**
> 
> - Vehicles are not allowed on the road; drivers may face fines or point deductions.
> 
> In short, China’s annual inspection is a mandatory safety and environmental check, whereas most U.S. states do not have a nationwide inspection system—only some require emissions or safety tests.

I don’t quite buy the idea of “dignified poverty.” It makes it sound like poor people somehow get to choose to stay dignified, like they still have options. In reality, in a capitalist country, most poverty is imposed by the capitalists, and even when you’re broke, they squeeze every last bit of labor out of you. It’s not dignified—it’s forced.

So why does this mix of extreme wealth and poverty happen in the U.S.? Because the wealth gap is huge. The rich always manage to sip a little extra “soup,” while ordinary people are poor and sometimes get a taste—but never enough to change their fate.

The first time I went to the U.S., I ate at an American-style restaurant run by a Taiwanese owner. She told me that her employees were very ambitious, working two jobs doing work they loved. One job was as a server at her restaurant, earning $18 per hour for 40 hours a week (servers also get tips; we spent $80 on a meal and gave $20 as a tip). The other job was taking care of pets on weekends, though she didn’t mention the income. My wife calculated and thought, “Americans are so lucky! Just working as a server with tips, working 22 days a month, you could make $5,000 a month.” Later we realized—it’s not that they are ambitious; it’s that they can’t survive without working two jobs.

你说的是三十年前的美国普通民众，但他们这些正面向上的精气神都已经被资本家和罪犯吸干了。一个国家的社会幸福与否就像在做加减法，那些勇于奋斗，恪守道德的旧工业时代的美国人已经被物质欲望淘汰了（虽然他们为美国社会奉献了很多），他们是加法，如果这个社会越来越烂，就证明做加法的越来越少，留下来的多数是做减法的。
中国人应该引以为戒，尤其在经济体量越来越庞大的今天，不要让那些做减法的混蛋越来越猖狂。

What you’re describing is the America of thirty years ago, the ordinary citizens with drive and moral integrity—but their vitality has long been drained by capitalists and criminals. A nation’s social well-being is like an equation of addition and subtraction: those who strive and adhere to ethics—the contributors of the old industrial America—represent addition. If society is deteriorating, it shows that the “adders” are becoming fewer, leaving mostly those who subtract.

The lesson for China is clear: especially as the economy grows ever larger, don’t let the “subtracters”—the unscrupulous, destructive people—run rampant.

在美国漂了30天，这5个"美式真相"，留学生都未必敢说透
当我坐在肯德基里，看着一个老美大爷蘸着蛋挞吃薯条时，我知道我的世界观已经彻底崩塌了。
是的，就是这么离谱。30天的美国之旅，让我收集了一堆颠覆三观的素材。这些东西太野了，野到我都不敢发朋友圈，怕被人举报传播不当言论。但今天我豁出去了，这5个美式真相，就算是在美国待了好几年的留学生，也未必敢当着父母的面说透。

** 真相一：美国穷人比你想象的更穷，富人比你想象的更离谱 **
刚下飞机那天，我住的酒店对面就是一个homeless camp。我还以为是什么音乐节现场呢，结果人家就是住在那里的。
第二天去超市买东西，看到一个大妈在checkout的时候，信用卡刷了三次都失败，最后她把购物车里的东西一样一样拿出来，最终只买了一袋面包和一瓶水。那一刻我的心里五味杂陈，因为我刚刚还在为要不要买15刀的蓝莓而纠结。
但是，就在同一天下午，我在比弗利山庄看到了什么？一个看起来20多岁的小伙子，开着一辆劳斯莱斯库里南，车上还贴着DADDY'S MONEY的标签。这得多嚣张才能把这种话贴车上？
更离谱的是，那天晚上我在一个高档餐厅吃饭，隔壁桌的一家人点了一瓶2000刀的酒，就为了配一个汉堡。我当时就想，这是什么魔幻现实主义？
在美国，贫富差距不是数字上的概念，是你真真切切能感受到的两个平行宇宙。一边是有人为了5刀的停车费发愁，另一边是有人把钱当纸花。这种撕裂感比任何电影都要震撼。

** 真相二：老美的政治正确已经魔怔到让人窒息 **
这个真的让我三观尽毁。
那天我在一个咖啡店，听到两个大学生在讨论课业。其中一个白人女生说：我觉得我们应该更多地学习亚洲文化的数学思维。
结果她的朋友立马紧张地说：你这样说是不是在stereotype亚洲人？
我当时就懵了，夸人都能被解读成歧视？这个逻辑我是真的理解不了。
更魔幻的是，我去参加一个社区活动，主持人在介绍自己的时候说：大家好，我是Jake，我的代词是he/him。然后底下的人开始鼓掌。
我旁边的一个老头悄悄跟我说：以前这里的人见面都是握手，现在握手都要先问对方同不同意。
最让我破防的是，我在一个书店想买一本关于中国历史的书，结果店员问我：你确定要买这本吗？作者是白人，可能存在cultural appropriation的问题。
一个外国人写中国历史就是文化挪用？那我们写外国历史算什么？文化入侵？
这种氛围让我感觉大家都在小心翼翼地说话，生怕踩到某个看不见的地雷。真实的交流变成了政治正确的表演，这比任何专制都要可怕。

** 真相三：美国的自由其实是有钱人的自由 **
这个话题太敏感了，但我必须说。
美国的自由，说白了就是有钱人的自由。没钱的人连生病的自由都没有。
我在洛杉矶的时候，认识了一个Uber司机，他告诉我他已经三个月没看医生了，因为看不起。他说：我宁愿死在路上，也不想让家人背上医疗债务。
这是什么鬼话？在一个号称世界上最发达的国家，有人因为看不起病而选择等死？
但是同时，我看到富人区的人们在讨论要不要换一个更好的家庭医生，因为现在的医生预约要等两天。两天，对他们来说都是不可接受的。
教育也是一样。我去参观了一个私立学校，设施豪华得像度假村，学费一年6万美金。而公立学校呢？我路过一个，窗户都是破的，操场上全是垃圾。
美国的自由，是有钱选择的自由。没钱的话，你连选择的权利都没有。

** 真相四：老美的友善很多时候是虚伪的表演 **
刚开始我还挺感动的，觉得美国人真的很友善。每个人见面都是How are you doing，服务员都是笑脸相迎。
但是住久了我发现，这都是套路。
那天我在一个餐厅，服务员对我笑容满面，各种honey sweetie地叫我。我还以为遇到了真正的热情呢。结果买单的时候，他把小费建议直接设成了25%，而且脸色立马就变了。
更离谱的是，我在一个party上，一个美国同学跟我聊了半天，各种compliment我的英语，说我很interesting。结果第二天在路上遇到，人家直接无视我，就像没见过我一样。
最让我心寒的是，我在一个社区活动中，看到一个老奶奶摔倒了。围观的人都在说Oh my god Are you okay，但是没有一个人真的去扶她。大家都在等别人先动手，怕承担责任。
这种虚假的友善比直接的冷漠更让人难受。至少冷漠是真实的，虚假的热情就是对人性的侮辱。

** 真相五：美国的多元文化其实是一种新的隔离 **
这个发现让我最震撼。
美国号称是多元文化的melting pot，但实际上，不同文化之间的隔离比我想象的要严重得多。
我在一个大学城观察了一个星期，发现食堂里的座位分布有个很明显的规律：亚洲学生坐一起，白人学生坐一起，黑人学生坐一起，拉丁裔学生坐一起。
这不是法律规定的隔离，而是一种自然的隔离。大家表面上都很友好，但实际上很少有真正的交集。
更魔幻的是，我参加了一个所谓的多元文化节，结果发现这就是一个各种文化的展示会。中国学生表演功夫，墨西哥学生跳传统舞蹈，印度学生展示咖喱。
这不是多元文化，这是文化动物园。每个人都被要求表演自己的文化特色，而不是作为一个完整的个体被看待。
我试图跟一个白人同学交流中国现代文化，比如说我们的互联网发展，他的反应是：哦，你们不是都用微信吗？我听说你们的网络被监控。
我跟你聊技术创新，你跟我聊政治监控。这就是美国式的多元文化理解吗？

** 写在最后：醒醒吧，美国梦该更新了 **
30天的美国之旅，让我明白了一个道理：任何国家都不是完美的，包括美国。
那些关于美国的刻板印象，无论是好的还是坏的，都需要被更新。美国不是天堂，也不是地狱，就是一个复杂的、矛盾的、有着各种问题的国家。
但是，这些问题不应该被粉饰，也不应该被夸大。它们就是存在的，就是需要被讨论的。
作为一个外来者，我没有资格指手画脚地说美国应该怎么样。但是作为一个观察者，我有责任把我看到的真实记录下来。
这些美式真相可能会让一些人不舒服，但是真相本来就不是为了让人舒服的。它们是为了让我们更好地理解这个世界，理解我们自己。
所以，下次再有人跟你说美国怎么样怎么样的时候，记住：任何简单的描述都是不够的。这个世界比我们想象的要复杂得多，也更有趣得多。

During my 30-day trip to the U.S., I witnessed things that completely overturned my expectations. Even international students living there for years might not dare to say these truths out loud.

![](images/2025/America-part1-11.webp (The rich are absurdly rich; the poor are shockingly poor))

1. The rich are absurdly rich; the poor are shockingly poor

The day I arrived, a homeless camp was right across from my hotel. Later, I saw a woman in a supermarket unable to pay for groceries, eventually leaving with just bread and water. That same day, I saw a 20-something driving a Rolls-Royce Cullinan with a “DADDY’S MONEY” sticker. The gap between rich and poor isn’t abstract—it’s a real, everyday parallel universe.

![](images/2025/America-part1-22.webp (Political correctness can be suffocating))

2. Political correctness can be suffocating

Complimenting someone can be interpreted as discrimination. I saw people introducing pronouns at events, and even buying a book on Chinese history as a foreigner could trigger a question about cultural appropriation. Social interactions are often more about caution than genuine connection.

![](images/2025/America-part1-33.webp (Freedom is reserved for the wealthy))

3. Freedom is reserved for the wealthy

A poor Uber driver hadn’t seen a doctor for months because he couldn’t afford it. Meanwhile, affluent neighborhoods worry about a two-day wait for a doctor’s appointment. Private schools cost $60,000 a year; public schools struggle with broken windows and trash. Real freedom in the U.S. is often just the freedom of choice for those with money.

![](images/2025/America-part1-44.webp (Friendliness can be a performance))

4. Friendliness can be a performance

Americans smile, greet, and compliment, but behind the facade, people often act out of routine or self-interest. I witnessed a crowd not helping an elderly woman who fell, and servers changing expressions if tips weren’t automatic. Superficial friendliness can feel worse than plain indifference.

![](images/2025/America-part1-55.webp (Multiculturalism often leads to segregation))

5. Multiculturalism often leads to segregation

In college cafeterias, students naturally cluster by ethnicity. Festivals display cultural performances like a “cultural zoo,” rather than fostering real interaction. Talking about Chinese tech or modern culture often met with shallow stereotypes. Multiculturalism exists more as spectacle than integration.

Final Thoughts: The American Dream Needs Updating

No country is perfect, not even America. Stereotypes—good or bad—should be challenged. The U.S. is neither paradise nor hell; it’s complex, contradictory, and full of lessons. Observing it firsthand reminds us that understanding reality requires looking beyond surface impressions.

美国的小费是对劳动人民的最直观的尊重，毕竟在美国从事服务业的人普遍都拿很低的底薪。如果没有小费，绝大多数服务业的从业人员是无法生存的。顾客根据所享受的服务质量来决定小费的多少，相当于把服务质量和服务报酬直接挂钩，能在一定程度上保证服务质量，是有其合理性的。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
Tipping in the U.S. is actually one of the most direct ways to respect service workers, because people in the service industry generally earn very low base salaries. Without tips, most service workers wouldn’t be able to make a living. Customers decide the amount of tip based on the quality of service they receive, effectively linking service quality to compensation. This system, in a way, helps ensure a certain level of service quality, so it does have its rationale.

如果底薪给的高，旱涝保收，那服务质量就不是很有保障。美国的小费制度，将服务业的从业人员的工资和服务质量直接挂钩，由被服务的顾客直接“打分”并付款，是有合理性的。美国的小费是顾客自愿性质的，不是必须付的。如果服务差，少付甚至不付小费都是正常的，这其中的作用是顾客给予服务差的服务业从业者的一个明确信号，就是对服务质量不满意，请加以改进。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
If the base salary were high and guaranteed regardless of performance, service quality wouldn’t be strongly incentivized. The U.S. tipping system directly links service workers’ income to the quality of their service, with customers effectively “grading” and paying them accordingly, which has its rationale. Tipping in the U.S. is voluntary, not mandatory. If the service is poor, leaving a small tip—or none at all—is normal. This serves as a clear signal from the customer to the service worker that the service quality was unsatisfactory and needs improvement.

在美国很简单，如果囊中羞涩，就别享受别人的服务。如果能花一百美金吃顿饭，那就绝不会差二十块钱小费，或者可去免小费的快餐店。如果坐出租花五十，难道会连七块小费都给不起？如果这么缺钱，还待在美国干什么呢？美国就是一个万事都靠钱来分配资源的社会。但凡说美国不好的，十有八九是因为没钱，是不是这样？:)
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
In the U.S., it’s simple: if you’re strapped for cash, don’t indulge in other people’s services. If you can spend $100 on a meal, missing out on a $20 tip is out of the question—or you can just go to tip-free fast food. If a taxi ride costs $50, can’t even spare $7 for a tip? If you’re that short on money, why even stay in the U.S.? The U.S. is a society where money essentially allocates all resources. Nine times out of ten, complaints about America come down to lack of money, right? :)

我在美国几十年，曾偶尔遇到过服务不好的，完全可不给小费，必要时可简单说明不加小费的原因，但必须是服务非常差。通常较好做法是酌情减少小费，别完全不给，毕竟在美国低于15%就已经是在表达对服务的不满了。如果服务没什么问题，又克扣小费，在美国是自贬身份，很丢脸的事。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
I’ve been in the U.S. for decades. Occasionally, I’ve encountered poor service, and in such cases, it’s completely acceptable not to leave a tip—if necessary, you can briefly explain why. But this only applies when the service is truly awful. The usual approach is to reduce the tip proportionally rather than skip it entirely, since tipping below 15% already signals dissatisfaction with the service. If the service was fine but you still withhold a tip, in the U.S. that’s seen as lowering your own social standing—pretty embarrassing.

如果是像曼哈顿华尔街牛排馆之类的full service的正餐厅，里面都是专业知识水平很高的职业企台professional waiter，那种服务真是享受，付些小费是心情很好的事。如果是快餐厅或简餐店，不付小费是完全可接受的。
</small>
</details>

<div class="translated-text">
If it’s a full-service restaurant like a steakhouse on Manhattan’s Wall Street, staffed with highly skilled professional waiters, the service is truly a pleasure, and leaving a tip becomes a genuinely enjoyable experience. For fast-food or casual dining places, not leaving a tip is completely acceptable.

中国和美国的国情不同。我只是说在美国，小费制度是服务业传统文化习惯的一部分，有它的合理性，也是美国人普遍接受的。在一定程度上，小费对保证服务的态度和质量是有一定的积极促进作用的，毕竟谁都不会嫌小费挣得太多了。

China and the U.S. have different national conditions. I’m just saying that in the U.S., tipping is a traditional cultural practice in the service industry.
